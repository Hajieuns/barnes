                <p>
                    The book that introduced us to the wizarding world, J.K. Rowing’s Harry Potter 
                    and the Sorcerer’s Stone is the beginning of a magical journey that changed the 
                    world. Follow the boy who lived as he navigates his first year at Hogwarts.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Harry Potter spent ten long years living with Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, an aunt and 
                    uncle whose outrageous favoritism of their perfectly awful son Dudley leads to 
                    some of the most inspired dark comedy since Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. 
                    But fortunately for Harry, he's about to be granted a scholarship to a unique 
                    boarding school called THE HOGWORTS SCHOOL OF WITCHCRAFT AND 
                    WIZARDRY, where he will become a school hero at the game of Quidditch (a 
                    kind of aerial soccer played high above the ground on broomsticks), he will make 
                    some wonderful friends, and, unfortunately, a few terrible enemies. For although 
                    he seems to be getting your run-of-the-mill boarding school experience (well, ok, 
                    even that's pretty darn out of the ordinary), Harry Potter has a destiny that he was 
                    born to fulfill. A destiny that others would kill to keep him from.

                    Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone in the UK in 1997. The series took 
                    another ten years to complete, concluding in 2007 with the publication of Harry 
                    Potter and the Deathly Hallows.

                    With the release of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, the first in a series of tales about a young wizard in training, an international craze 
                    was born. Not since C. S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia has a children's tale of magic and mystery so enthralled the reading public. And it's easy to see
                     why. Eleven-year-old Harry Potter, the plucky yet nerdy hero of this series, is the embodiment of every uncool kid's fantasy. Unpopular in school, picked on 
                    by bullies, and persecuted by his adoptive family, the disheveled and bespectacled Harry manages to not only survive but thrive by discovering friends, 
                    magical powers, and a great destiny he never knew he had.

                    Harry hates living with his Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and their spoiled-rotten son, Dudley. Harry's room is a tiny closet beneath the stairs, and the entire 
                    family treats him with disdain. What's more, Harry keeps getting into trouble for making strange things happen -- things he seems to have no control over.
                     But then Harry discovers the truth about himself when a determined messenger delivers an enlightening message. It turns out that Harry's mother was a 
                    witch, his father a wizard. And not only is Harry also a wizard, he's a famous one! His survival of the attack by the evil wizard who killed his parents has 
                    marked him as a legendary hero -- as has the lightning-bolt-shaped scar on his forehead.

                    Soon Harry finds himself attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where he receives training in some magic basics, masters riding a 
                    broomstick, and discovers his incredible talent for a game called Quidditch, which is played in the air on flying brooms. And for the first time in his life, 
                    Harry has friends who care about him: his fellow students Hermione and Ron and a giant named Hagrid. But all is not rosy when Harry discovers his true
                     destiny and finds he must once again face the evil one who killed his parents. His survival will depend upon the help of his newfound friends, as well as his 
                    own wit and powers.

                    It's easy to see why Harry Potter has caught the reading public's fancy. Not only are his adventures an entertaining mix of fright, fantasy, and fun, his 
                    triumphs over everyday adversities offer a heartening lesson to kids everywhere.

                        Hary Potter is one of the best books of the year. Magical writing, wonderful descriptions, and very intriguing characters make an amazing book. I personally 
                        like Harry Potter, both the book and the character, and now I'm enjoying Harry Potter with my class. I loved the book so much, that I read #2 (Chamber of 
                        Secrets), #3 (Prisoner of Azkaban), and when #4 comes out, I'll definitely read that one!

                        When Harry turned 10 years old, he was sent to a wizarding school, called Hogswarts. There he met his friends Ron and Hermione.

                        A wonderful first novel....Harry is destined for greatness...and one day he mysteriously receives a notice in the mail announcing that he has been chosen 
                        to attend Hogwarts, the nation's elite school for training wizards and witches, the Harvard of sorcery. Before he is done, Harry Potter will meet a dragon, 
                        make friends with a melancholy centaur and do battle with a three-headed dog....Through all this hocus-pocus is delightful, the magic in the book is not the 
                        real magic of the book. Much like Roald Dahl, J.K. Rowling has a gift for keeping the emotions, fears and triumphs of her characters on a human scale, even 
                        while the supernatural is popping out all over.

                        Chicago Tribune
                        A rousing first novel, an award-winner in England. Harry is just a baby when his magical parents are done in by Voldemort, a wizard so dastardly other 
                        wizards are scared to mention his name. So Harry is brought up by his mean Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia Dursley, and picked on by his horrid cousin 
                        Dudley. He knows nothing about his magical birthright until 10 years later, when he learns he's to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
                        Hogwarts is a lot like English boarding school, except that instead of classes in math and grammar, the curriculum features courses in Transfiguration, 
                        Herbology, and Defense Against the Dark Arts. Harry becomes the star player of Quidditch, a sort of mid-air ball game. With the help of his new friends 
                        Ron and Hermione, Harry solves a mystery involving a sorcerer's stone that ultimately takes him to the evil Voldemort. This hugely enjoyable fantasy is 
                        filled with imaginative details, from oddly flavored jelly beans to dragons' eggs hatched on the hearth. It's slanted toward action-oriented readers, who will 
                        find that Briticisms meld with all the other wonders of magic school.

                        From the Publisher
                        If you haven't heard of Harry Potter then you haven't turned on your TV or radio or opened a newspaper in the last few months. For the uninitiated, Harry 
                        is a young orphan who is living with his nasty relatives when he's summoned to claim his magical heritage by attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and 
                        Wizardry. What could be better (or more satisfying to children) than studying, not English and chemistry, but Potions and Defense-Against-the-Dark-Arts? 
                        Jim Dale, with his fully voiced reading, brings the world of wizards to life in ways unimagined even by those who have read and re-read the book. The accents 
                        are sure, the inflections perfectly suit the characters, and some of Rowling's particularly inventive bits, like the game of Quidditch, become clearer. Sometimes 
                        poignant, often funny, Dale's interpretation of this enchanted other world is the consummate family-listening experience. S.G. Winner of AUDIOFILE
