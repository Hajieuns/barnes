                <h3>Notes From Your Bookseller</h3>
                <p>
                    Raised on an isolated island by a magician, a young woman discovers things aren’t 
                    as they seem and must embark on a journey to return magic to the world. A lush 
                    and lyrical historical fantasy that’s filled with humor, wit, great characters, and 
                    dreamy writing.

                    In the early 1900s, a young woman is caught between two worlds in H. G. Parry’s 
                    cozy tale of magic, miracles, and an adventure of a lifetime 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Off the coast of Ireland sits a legendary island hidden by magic. A place of ruins and 
                    ancient trees, sea salt air, and fairy lore, Hy-Brasil is the only home Biddy has ever

                </p>
                <p>
                    One night, Rowan fails to return from his mysterious travels. To find him, Biddy 
                    must venture into the outside world for the first time. But Rowan has powerful 
                    enemies—forces who have hoarded the world’s magic and have set their sights on 
                    the magician’s many secrets.       
                </p>
                <p>
                    Biddy may be the key to stopping them. Yet the closer she gets to answers, the more 
                    she questions everything she’s ever believed about Rowan, her past, and the nature 
                    of magic itself.

                    Parry (A Radical Act of Free Magic) continues her hot streak of well-researched historical fantasy with this mix of bildungsroman and love 
                    letter to the 19th-century English canon. Sixteen-year-old Bridget “Biddy” Adler has lived her entire life on the hidden, enchanted island of 
                    Hy-Brasil with her adoptive father, the Irish woodmage Rowan O’Connell, and his rabbit familiar, Hutchincroft. Then the British Council 
                    of Mages comes after Rowan for stealing magic at a time when the magic-granting schisms have all closed, and the Council wants all magic 
                    conserved. Biddy departs the isle for 19th-century London, aiming to set a trap for the Council members—only to be captured by them 
                    herself, and told that everything she knows about herself and Rowan is a lie. The novel inexplicably treats Rowan’s former fiancée, 
                    Morgaine, much more harshly than other, more culpable members of the corrupt Council, creating a weird imbalance in the portrayal 
                    of the villains, but the magic system—which posits magic as a nonrenewable resource—works wonderfully as a metaphor for capitalism 
                    after 19th-century industrialization. Parry’s fans will not be disappointed. Agent: Hannah Bowman, Liza Dawson Assoc. (Feb.)

                        Parry (A Radical Act of Free Magic) writes a coming-of-age fantasy set in an alternate 1912 London filled with heartbreak and wonder, as 
                        protagonist Biddy has to literally spread her wings and fly to save her guardians and magic itself. It's also a found-family story where Biddy 
                        is forced to question everything she has ever believed about herself and magic. The magic started draining out of Biddy's world long before 
                        she was born, but the legendary Hy-Brasil, where she was raised, has a bit of it left. That magic, Biddy's magical guardians, and Biddy herself 
                        are pursued by a Mages' Council determined to steal what little is left—unless Biddy and her guardians take the fight to them in one last
                         desperate gamble to find the place magic has hidden. Either they let magic loose again in a world condemned to gloom and deprivation, or 
                        it will be hoarded and abused by those who have been chasing Biddy—because she holds the only key. VERDICT Highly recommended for 
                        fans of heroine's journeys, steampunk alternate worlds, and stories about what happens after the magic goes away.—Marlene Harris

                        Biddy has only ever known the magical island of Hy-Brasil, where she lives in a crumbling castle. Hy-Brasil is hidden by ancient magic, so it’s 
                        the perfect home for Biddy and her eccentric guardian, Rowan, a magician who won’t tell Biddy exactly why he needs to hide out on a secret 
                        island. Rowan and his familiar, a rabbit spirit named Hutchincroft, have provided Biddy with a wonderful, loving home, but as Biddy nears 
                        her 17th birthday she starts to feel some growing pains. Why is Rowan so resistant to letting her go to the mainland? What does Rowan do on 
                        his mysterious nightly trips off the island? And is Rowan’s story about Biddy washing up on shore as an infant even true? When Rowan can no 
                        longer shield Biddy from the truth about his dangerous enemies. Biddy realizes that in getting her wish to leave Hy-Brasil, she may be in for more 
                        than she bargained for. Parry's greatest gift as a fantasy author isn’t her ability to create magic systems that are both easily understandable and 
                        also detailed and immersive. Nor is it her knack for settings, as in the delightful and whimsical images of Hy-Brasil. Instead, it is how she takes 
                        those worldbuilding skills and uses them in service of deeply felt characters. As Biddy fights to help Rowan battle his enemies, she learns how 
                        people and problems are always more complex than they seem but that courage and a good heart will always win the day. What more can you 
                        ask for from a coming-of-age story?

                        Rose McPhilemy's stellar performance underscores the dual sides of magic--delight and danger--in this immersive historical fantasy. Having lived 
                        her whole life on the hidden island of Hy-Brasil, Biddy is eager to explore the world beyond. But when her caretakers, the mage Rowan and his 
                        rabbit familiar Hutchincroft, open up a decades-old magical battle, Biddy gets more than she hoped for. She encounters mysterious creatures, finds 
                        power in unlikely places, and learns that the key to everything lies in her heart. Biddy must decide whom to trust and whether restoring magic to 
                        the world is worth the costs. McPhilemy blends Rowan's rough Irish accent with Hutchincroft's clear British lilt to create a unique voice just for 
                        Biddy. It's this nuanced combination that makes McPhilemy's performance truly unforgettable. A.A.H. Winner of AudioFile Earphones Award
