                <p>
                    David Graeber and David Wengrow, an anthropologist and an archaelologist, join 
                    forces to dig deep and long through 30,000 years of human history, looking to 
                    explain anew who we are and how we got from there to here. Immersive, 
                    commanding and incendiary, Dawn of Everything brings to mind the works of Jared 
                    Diamond, Yuval Noah Harari and Stephen Pinker, and then “takes them on.” Get 
                    yourself a seat at the showdown, and tuck into an extraordinary work of discovery.

                <p class="bold">
                    A dramatically new understanding of human history, challenging our most 
                    fundamental assumptions about social evolution—from the development of 
                    agriculture and cities to the origins of the state, democracy, and inequality—and 
                    revealing new possibilities for human emancipation. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For generations, our remote ancestors have been cast as primitive and childlike—
                    either free and equal innocents, or thuggish and warlike. Civilization, we are told, 
                    could be achieved only by sacrificing those original freedoms or, alternatively, by 
                    taming our baser instincts. David Graeber and David Wengrow show how such 
                    theories first emerged in the eighteenth century as a conservative reaction to 
                    powerful critiques of European society posed by Indigenous observers and 
                    intellectuals. Revisiting this encounter has startling implications for how we make 
                    sense of human history today, including the origins of farming, property, cities, 
                    democracy, slavery, and civilization itself.           
                </p>
                <p>
                    Drawing on pathbreaking research in archaeology and anthropology, the authors 
                    show how history becomes a far more interesting place once we learn to throw off 
                    our conceptual shackles and perceive what’s really there. If humans did not spend 
                    95 percent of their evolutionary past in tiny bands of hunter-gatherers, what were 
                    they doing all that time? If agriculture, and cities, did not mean a plunge into 
                    hierarchy and domination, then what kinds of social and economic organization did 
                    they lead to? The answers are often unexpected, and suggest that the course of 
                    human history may be less set in stone, and more full of playful, hopeful possibilities, 
                    than we tend to assume.        
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Dawn of Everything fundamentally transforms our understanding of the human 
                    past and offers a path toward imagining new forms of freedom, new ways of 
                    organizing society. This is a monumental book of formidable intellectual range, 
                    animated by curiosity, moral vision, and a faith in the power of direct action.

                    The transition from hunter-gatherer life to agriculture, urbanism, and civilization saw a blossoming of egalitarian politics and social 
                    order, according to this sweeping manifesto. Surveying 26,000-year-old European graves, Stone Age Turkish towns, the musings of 
                    17th-century Iroquois philosophers, and more, archaeologist Wengrow (What Makes Civilization?) and anthropologist Graeber (Debt), 
                    who died last year, critique conventional theories of historical development. Far from simplistic savages living in a state of “childlike 
                    innocence,” they argue, hunter-gatherers could be sophisticated thinkers with diverse economies and sizable towns; moreover, agriculture
                     and urbanism did not necessarily birth private property, class hierarchies, and authoritarian government, they contend, since many early 
                    farming societies and cities were egalitarian and democratic. Vast in scope and dazzling in erudite detail, the book seethes with intriguing
                     ideas; unfortunately, though, the authors’ habitual overgeneralizations—“one cannot even say that medieval thinkers rejected the notion
                     of social equality: the idea that it might exist seems never to have occurred to them”—undermine confidence in their method of grand 
                    speculation from tenuous evidence. (For example, they see “evidence for the world’s first documented social revolution” in the damaged
                     condition of elite habitations in the 4,000-year-old ruins of the Chinese city of Taosi.) Readers will find this stimulating and provocative,
                     but not entirely convincing. (Nov.)

                        Wengrow (archaeology, Univ. Coll. London) and the late Graeber (anthropology, London Sch. of Economics) successfully disrupt the story 
                        popularly believed about the rise of civilization: starting from small bands of peaceful hunter-gatherers, an agricultural revolution led to cities, 
                        which led to hierarchy and eventually the modern nation-state, where technological progress is bought at the cost of liberty and equality. Instead,
                         they decentralize these founding mythologies of Western culture by examining Indigenous counterexamples from around the globe, spanning 
                        the Neolithic period to today. By synthesizing modern evidence from their two disciplines, they demonstrate that societies have been much
                         more flexible, diverse, and creative in their social structures, adapting and reacting to their physical environs, their values, and their neighbors,
                         and not merely constrained by technological or economic efficiencies. Asking questions about the origins of inequality or of the state requires
                         defining those terms, and it quickly becomes obvious that there is no all-encompassing definition of either, and no inevitable social or political
                         arrangement that history is guiding us toward. VERDICT This well-reasoned survey of anthropological history should intrigue historians, 
                        social activists, and fans of Yuval Noah Harari's Sapiens or Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel.— Wade Lee-Smith, Univ. of Toledo Lib.

                        Graeber, a former professor of anthropology at London School of Economics who died in 2020, and Wengrow, professor of comparative 
                        archaeology at University College London, take a dim view of conventional accounts of the rise of civilizations, emphasize contributions from
                         Indigenous cultures and the missteps of the great Enlightenment thinkers, and draw countless thought-provoking conclusions. In 1651, British
                         philosopher Thomas Hobbes proclaimed that humans require laws and government authority because life in primitive cultures was “poor, 
                        nasty, brutish, and short.” A few decades later, French thinker Rousseau wrote that humans in a state of nature were free until they acquired 
                        property that required legal protection. Graeber and Wengrow point out that these conceptions of historical progression dominate the opinions
                         of many experts, who assume that society passed through stages of development: hunter-gatherers, farmers, urban-industrial society, and so on.
                         Graeber and Wengrow maintain that no scientific evidence supports this view, adding that traditional scholarship says little about “prehistory,”
                         during which supposedly egalitarian hunter-gatherers roamed and foraged until about 10,000 years ago, when they purportedly took up
                         agriculture and things became interesting. This orthodox view dismisses countless peoples who had royal courts and standing armies, built
                         palaces, and accumulated wealth. As the authors write, “there is simply no reason to assume that the adoption of agriculture in more remote
                         periods also meant the inception of private land ownership, territoriality, or an irreversible departure from forager egalitarianism.” 
                        Many early cities thrived for centuries with no sign of hierarchy, contradicting scholars who assume that authoritarian rule appears naturally 
                        whenever large populations gather. The quest for the “origin of the state,” given scattered and contradictory evidence, may be a fool’s errand. 
                        Graeber and Wengrow, while providing no definitive answers, cast grave doubts on those theories that have been advanced to date.

                        "An ingenious new look at 'the broad sweep of human history' and many of its 'foundational' stories . . . [Graeber and Wengrow] take a
                        dim view of conventional accounts of the rise of civilizations, emphasize contributions from Indigenous cultures and the missteps of the 
                       great Enlightenment thinkers, and draw countless thought-provoking conclusions . . . A fascinating, intellectually challenging big book
                        about big ideas."

                        "Pacey and potentially revolutionary . . . the argument of the book is firmly based on a deluge of recent evidence that suggests that 
                        pre-agricultural societies were complex, that agriculture was not the sudden turning point it is claimed to be and, most importantly, 
                        that large, successful systems such as cities have been run without central, rule-giving controllers . . . This is more than an argument 
                        about the past, it is about the human condition in the present."

                        "The Dawn of Everything reimagines the human story from its earliest beginnings. Easily one of my favorite books of the year, every 
                        chapter left me with something to chew over. This is one of those books that will challenge you to reconsider everything."

                        "As new discoveries upend what we think we know about human history, it is time to jettison old narratives and tell new stories about 
                        ancestors who were as human—and thus as vibrant, intelligent and complicated—as ourselves. Graeber and Wengrow take on this task 
                        with verve and passion."

                        “Graeber and Wengrow have effectively overturned everything I ever thought about the history of the world. A thorough and elegant 
                        refutation of evolutionary theories of history, The Dawn of Everything introduces us to a world populated by smart, creative, complicated
                         people who, for thousands of years, invented virtually every form of social organization imaginable and pursued freedom, knowledge,
                         experimentation, and happiness way before the “Enlightenment.” The authors don’t just debunk the myths, they give a thrilling intellectual 
                        history of how they came about, why they persist, and what it all means for the just future we hope to create. The most profound and exciting 
                        book I’ve read in thirty years.”

                        “This is not a book. This is an intellectual feast. There is not a single chapter that does not (playfully) disrupt well seated intellectual beliefs. 
                        It is deep, effortlessly iconoclastic, factually rigorous, and pleasurable to read.”

                    <span>
                        “The Dawn of Everything is also the radical revision of everything, liberating us from the familiar stories about humanity’s past that are too often
                        deployed to impose limitations on how we imagine humanity’s future. Instead they tell us that what human beings are most of all is creative, from
                        the beginning, so that there is no one way we were or should or could be. Another of the powerful currents running through this book is a reclaiming
                        of Indigenous perspectives as a colossal influence on European thought, a valuable contribution to decolonizing global histories.”
                       —Rebecca Solnit, author of Hope in the Dark and Orwell’s Roses

                    <span>
                        “Not content with different answers to the great questions of human history, Graeber and Wengrow insist on revolutionizing the very questions we
                        ask. The result: a dazzling, original, and convincing account of the rich, playful, reflective, and experimental symposia that ‘pre-modern’ indigenous 
                       life represents; and a challenging re-writing of the intellectual history of anthropology and archaeology. The Dawn of Everything deserves to become 
                       the port of embarkation for virtually all subsequent work on these massive themes. Those who do embark will have, in the two Davids, 
                       incomparable navigators.”

                    <span>
                        “Synthesizing much recent scholarship, The Dawn of Everything briskly overthrows old and obsolete assumptions about the past, renews our 
                        intellectual and spiritual resources, and reveals, miraculously, the future as open-ended. It is the most bracing book I have read in recent years.”

                    <span>
                        “Graeber and Wengrow take up a question as old as Rousseau—the origin of social inequality—only to reveal that it predates Rousseau and may
                        in fact be the wrong question, based on rubbish history and reactionary speculation. Scavenging through the most up-to-date archaeological 
                       research and most recent anthropological record, the authors give us a world more various and unexpected than we knew, and more open and
                        free than we imagine. This is social theory in the grand, old-fashioned sense, delivered with spell-binding velocity and an exhilarating sense of discovery.”

                    <span>
                        "A fascinating inquiry, which leads us to rethink the nature of human capacities, as well as the proudest moments of our own history, and our
                        interactions with and indebtedness to the cultures and forgotten intellectuals of indigenous societies. Challenging and illuminating."

                    <span>
                        “Graeber and Wengrow debug cliches about humanity's deep history to open up our thinking about what's possible in the future. There is no 
                        more vital or timely project.”

                        British actor Mark Williams seems sadly miscast as narrator for this provocative re-examination of the last 30,000 years of human history, 
                        which has drawn wide attention for upending many established notions about competition and social hierarchy. At 24 hours, this is a challenging
                         listening experience, one that requires time and attention, and, most importantly, a steady and unobtrusive narrator. Williams’s distinctive
                         voice borders on the eccentric, with a hard beat at the end of each phrase. This jaunty, comfortably tweedy tone, which is right for a Harry
                         Potter character, is too distinctive, and too far off the tone of this particular narrative. However, listeners who can adjust to the accent will
                         be swept up by this audiobook’s boldness of vision. D.A.W. © AudioFile 2022, Portland, Maine
