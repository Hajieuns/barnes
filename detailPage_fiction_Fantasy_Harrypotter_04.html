                <p class="nonunder">
                    Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the fourth book in the series. Harry returns 
                    to Hogwarts with nightmares about Voldemort looming in his head. This year, 
                    there is an exciting event at Hogwarts, but will it be more dangerous than fun? 
                    Between the weird dreams Harry's been having, his scar hurting, and rumors of 
                    the Dark Lord's return, Harry's godfather Sirius Black grows increasingly 
                    concerned as he tries to ensure Harry's safety. Will Harry's nightmares come 
                    true? Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is an exciting story you won't want 
                    to put down with surprises you wouldn't expect.

                    The paperback edition of the legendary, record-breaking, best-selling fourth 
                    Harry Potter novel.
                    Harry Potter is midway through his training as a wizard and his coming of age. 
                    Harry wants to get away from the pernicious Dursleys and go to the 
                    International Quidditch Cup. He wants to find out about the mysterious event 
                    that's supposed to take place at Hogwarts this year, an event involving two other 
                    rival schools of magic, and a competition that hasn't happened for a hundred 
                    years. He wants to be a normal, fourteen-year-old wizard. But unfortunately for 
                    Harry Potter, he's not normal - even by wizarding standards. And in his case, 
                    different can be deadly.

                        Harry Potter is back in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and this time, the magic gets out of hand!      
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        First, imagine if you will, the sleepy but mysterious village of Little Hangleton, and what happened at the Riddle House. No, the Riddle House is not a place 
                        for riddles, but a home where the family died of fright. The man accused of murdering them was eventually released, but when he returns to the Riddle 
                        House, he overhears a curious conversation between someone named Wormtail and a terrible, dark presence by the name of Lord Voldemort -- 
                        oh, so sorry…He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Volde... (oops, almost said it again) He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is one of the most powerful Dark 
                        wizards -- and he wants Harry Potter.    
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        When Harry wakes from a particularly vivid dream, the scar on his forehead throbs, and he knows something is up. Harry's been living in a dreadful house 
                        on Privet Drive with his Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and greedy cousin, Dudley. They won't even let him do any wizardry -- you know Muggles, how they 
                        can't really handle that kind of stuff.     
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        Harry's uncle and aunt like to let the neighbors think that Harry goes to St. Brutus's Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys rather than to Hogwarts 
                        School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He has to hide his magic -- and even broomsticks aren't a suitable topic of conversation in the Dursley household. But 
                        everything is about to change for Harry, beginning with this particular summer vacation.    
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        It starts with a letter from Mrs. Weasley, Harry's friend Ron's mother. She invites him to come spend the rest of the summer with the Weasleys and to go 
                        see the Quidditch World Cup. Quidditch is Harry's favorite sport in the world, and it isn't often that the Quidditch World Cup is in Britain. Faster than you 
                        can say "Hogwarts," Harry travels by fire to the Burrow, and the dark and threatening adventure begins.       
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        On the way, Harry discovers that his interest in girls is becoming more nerve-wracking -- how is a young wizard to ask a girl to the Yule Ball? And what 
                        of the Goblet of Fire itself? And the Triwizard Tournament? And then, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named might be seeking Harry out even now!

                        Who can resist a Harry Potter tale? J. K. Rowling has proven again that her international success seemed inevitable. It is beautifully written, with a 
                        strong narrative and fascinating, unforgettable characters, and there is not a child or adult in the world who won't love this story. Not one word is wasted.

                    <span>
                        Now, my only problem is I need to find Harry so I can start classes at Hogwarts, soon. I sent him a message by owl, just this morning.

                    <span>
                        The novel opens as a confused Muggle overhears Lord Voldemort and his henchman, Wormtail (the escapee from book three, Azkaban) discussing a murder 
                        and plotting more deaths (and invoking Harry Potter's name); clues suggest that Voldemort and Wormtail's location will prove highly significant.

                    <span>
                        From here it takes a while (perhaps slightly too long a while) for Harry and his friends to get back to the Hogwarts school, where Rowling is on surest 
                        footing. Headmaster Dumbledore appalls everyone by declaring that Quidditch competition has been canceled for the year, then he makes the exciting 
                        announcement that the Triwizard Tournament is to be held after a cessation of many hundred years (it was discontinued, he explains, because the death toll 
                        mounted so high). One representative from each of the three largest wizardry schools of Europe (sinister Durmstrang, luxurious Beauxbatons and Hogwarts) 
                        are to be chosen by the Goblet of Fire; because of the mortal dangers, Dumbledore casts a spell that allows only students who are at least 17 to drop their 
                        names into the Goblet. Thus no one foresees that the Goblet will announce a fourth candidate: Harry. Who has put his name into the Goblet, and how is his 
                        participation in the tournament linked, as it surely must be, to Voldemort's newest plot?   
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        The details are as ingenious and original as ever, and somehow (for catching readers off-guard must certainly get more difficult with each successive volume)
                        Rowling plants the red herrings, the artful clues and tricky surprises that disarm the most attentive audience. A climax even more spectacular than that of 
                       Azkaban will leave readers breathless; the muscle-building heft of this volume notwithstanding, the clamor for book five will begin as soon as readers finish installment four.

                        death strikes, it's a shock. Readers might think they know who's on what side and what they're after, but don't be too sure. Rowling is really good at 
                        turning smoking guns into red herrings....So, how long until book five?

                        [T]his is storytelling of a high order indeed. It draws the reader in with a riddle and a letter. It proceeds through a series of trials to a great confrontation. 
                        And it concludes with a death and a climactic resolution. E.M. Forster famously observed that, 'Yes - oh dear, yes - the novel tells a story'. HP IV is the 
                        apotheosis of 'story.'

                        Children (and many of us who aren't) have been so anxious for the fourth installment of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series because they are caught up in a 
                        breathless adventure, because they have learned to ask the most vital and essential question any reader can: What happens next? "But," the still-puzzled 
                        persist, "aren't there other children's books that are just as good?" Perhaps. But for kids, "Harry Potter" is of their time, something that will always be 
                        theirs instead of a legacy left to them by a previous generation....Like all great fantasy sagas, the Harry Potter books have grown narratively, morally and 
                        psychologically more complex as the series progresses. There is a special pressure on a writer who midway through a series finds herself entrusted with the 
                        imagination of a huge number of readers. That Rowling has done nothing to break that faith seems a deed as brave and noble as any her hero has accomplished.

                        The Harry Potter series is a supernatural version of ''Tom Brown's Schooldays,'' updated and given a hip this-is-how-kids-really-are shine. And Harry is 
                        the kid most children feel themselves to be, adrift in a world of unimaginative and often unpleasant adults -- Muggles, Rowling calls them -- who neither 
                        understand them nor care to. Harry is, in fact, a male Cinderella, waiting for someone to invite him to the ball. In Potter 1, his invitation comes first by 
                        owl (in the magic world of J. K. Rowling, owls deliver the mail) and then by Sorting Hat; in the current volume it comes from the Goblet of Fire, smoldering 
                        and shedding glamorous sparks. How nice to be invited to the ball! Even for a relatively old codger like me, it's still nice to be invited to the ball.

                        Ages 9-12 Even without the unprecedented media attention and popularity her magical series has attracted, it would seem too much to hope that Rowling 
                        could sustain the brilliance and wit of her first three novels. Astonishingly, Rowling seems to have the spell-casting powers she assigns her characters: this

                        Gr 4 Up-Harry Potter is back in J.K. Rowling's fourth installment of his adventures (Scholastic, 2000). He is 14 years old and in his fourth year at the 
                        Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where the traditional Inter-House Quidditch Cup has been temporarily suspended so that the Triwizard 
                        Tournament can be held. Only three students, one from each of the biggest schools of wizardry, may compete, but the Goblet of Fire that chooses the 
                        champions from each school mysteriously produces a fourth name--Harry Potter. As the school readies for the tournament, it becomes obvious to Harry's
                         allies that Voldemort is plotting something dastardly--but only at the very end does he show his hand, springing a trap that Harry only narrowly escapes. 
                        Jim Dale, who has narrated the previous Harry Potter audiobooks, succeeds marvelously at the Herculean effort of voicing about 125 characters. By now, 
                        Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid are so well known to him that his renditions of their voices are practiced and flawless. He also invests new characters 
                        such as Mad-Eye Moody and Winky with voices that enhance their already vivid personalities. Dale intones magical commands with such great authority 
                        that one would almost think he was a wizard himself. Twenty hours is a long time to listen to a book, but the combination of Rowling's enthralling 
                        adventure and Dale's limber narration will easily see kids through to the very last sentence.-Eva Mitnick, Los Angeles Public Library, CA Copyright 2000

                        The legend continues. Rowling's audacious series about the world's most beloved boy wizard moves into classic mode when fourteen-year-old Harry 
                        encounters his most daring challenges so far, confronting You-Know-Who and overcoming a daunting series of tasks in the process. Rowling's wisely 
                        inventive twist on the previous books is to eschew the ponderous exposition that halted the openings of books Two and Three, The Chamber of Secrets 
                        and The Prisoner of Azkaban. Instead, she provides a powerhouse opening chapter that lays the groundwork for the spellbinding twists and turns that 
                        follow. Harry knows disaster surrounds him even as he sets off with his favorite family, the Weasleys, for the four hundred twenty-second Quidditch World 
                        Cup Final Match against Ireland and Bulgaria, a speedy but heart-stopping event. Later, at Hogwarts, the students discover that the annual interschool 
                        quidditch matches are displaced by an even greater competition, the Triwizard Tournament. When Harry's name is drawn from the goblet of fire--despite 
                        the fact that he is underage--he endures Herculean tasks that test magical prowess, daring, powers of deduction and the ability to cope with danger. All of
                         this moves inexorably toward a definitive, horrifying face-off with Lord Voldemort. Rowling balances the darkness of the novel with some delightfully 
                        raucous highlights. Every reader will have his favorite book in the series. Some might find Rowling overloading the goodies in this one, but, in this case, 
                        more is better. What a shame to have to wait another year to find out what happens next.

                        As the bells and whistles of the greatest prepublication hoopla in children's book history fade, what's left in the clearing smoke is—unsurprisingly, 
                        considering Rowling's track record—another grand tale of magic and mystery, of wheels within wheels oiled in equal measure by terror and comedy, 
                        featuring an engaging young hero-in-training who's not above the occasional snit, and clicking along so smoothly that it seems shorter than it is. Good 
                        thing, too, with this page count. That's not to say that the pace doesn't lag occasionally—particularly near the end when not one but two bad guys halt 
                        the action for extended accounts of their misdeeds and motives—or that the story lacks troubling aspects. As Harry wends his way through a fourth year
                         of pranks, schemes, intrigue, danger and triumph at Hogwarts, the racial and class prejudice of many wizards moves to the forefront, with hooded wizards 
                        gathering to terrorize an isolated Muggle family in one scene while authorities do little more than wring their hands. There's also the later introduction of 
                        Hogwarts' house elves as a clan of happy slaves speaking nonstandard English. These issues may be resolved in sequels, but in the meantime, they are likely 
                        to leave many readers, particularly American ones, uncomfortable. Still, opening with a thrilling quidditch match, and closing with another wizardly 
                        competition that is also exciting, for very different reasons, this sits at the center of Rowling's projected seven volume saga and makes a sturdy, heartstopping
                         (doorstopping) fulcrum for it. (Fiction. All ages)

                        What’s wonderful about the Harry Potter stories is the believability of the world Harry and company inhabit, imagined by J.K. Rowling and fully realized 
                        through Jim Dale’s portrayal. At first, we were as awed as Harry to learn about the wonders of the magical world; now we’re as comfortable with what has 
                        become familiar. Dale fosters this expectation, bringing his symphony of voices back to each book even as he’s adding more. There’s an epic game of 
                        Quidditch, brought brilliantly into play as Dale narrates spectators and announcer alike, but overall, this is a darker adventure. As the Tri-Wizard 
                        Tournament unfolds, innocence gives way to knowledge and experience, trust is betrayed, and there’s as much horror as hilarity. (Some gruesome events 
                        near the conclusion might be frightening for younger listeners.) Harry’s growing up, and, with this installment, he’s firmly on course to his destiny. J.M.D.
