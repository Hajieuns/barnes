                <p>
                    Ascending to the throne at only 25, this self-effacing monarch navigated endless 
                    setbacks, family conflict, and occasional triumphs throughout her 70 years as the 
                    Queen of England. As her mettle was tested, she endeavored to keep the monarchy 
                    relevant culturally, socially, and politically, often in the face of resistance from inside 
                    the institution itself. And yet the greatest challenges she faced were often inside her 
                    own family, forever under intense scrutiny; from rumors about her husband’s 
                    infidelity, her sister’s marital breakdown, Princess Diana’s tragic death, to the recent 
                    departure of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.

                    Now in The Queen, renowned biographer Andrew Morton takes an in-depth look at 
                    Britain’s longest reigning monarch, exploring the influence Queen Elizabeth had on 
                    both Britain and the rest of the world for much of the last century. From leading a 
                    nation struggling to restore itself after the devastation of the second World War to 
                    navigating the divisive political landscape of the present day, Queen Elizabeth was a 
                    reluctant but resolute queen. This is the story of a woman of unflagging self-
                    discipline who will long be remembered as mother and grandmother to Great 
                    Britain, and one of the greatest sovereigns of the modern era.

                    Biographer Morton (Elizabeth & Margaret) reveals “the woman behind the mask” in this fluid if familiar biography of Queen Elizabeth II. 
                    He begins in 1936, when King Edward VIII abdicated to marry American divorcée Wallis Simpson, elevating Elizabeth’s father to the throne 
                    and sending the 10-year-old princess to scratch out the name “Simpson” from her books. Also noted are the scandal caused by governess 
                    Marion “Crawfie” Crawford’s 1950 memoir about her time with the royal family, and Elizabeth’s reluctance to seriously consider other 
                    suitors after naval cadet Philip Mountbatten “caught the eye of the princess” aboard the royal yacht in 1939. Elizabeth’s heightened role
                     during WWII “emphasized and endorsed her stoical, reserved character,” according to Morton, and led to sibling rivalry with her sister 
                    Margaret as she assumed more responsibilities. In a speech broadcast on her 21st birthday, Elizabeth vowed to the British public that she
                     would devote her life “to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong”; less than five years later, she
                     acceded to the throne after her father’s death. Morton also delves into the “existential crisis” caused by the simultaneous implosions of
                     Prince Charles and Prince Andrew’s marriages, and recounts Prince Harry’s demands that his fiancée Meghan Markle receive a special
                     tiara fitting before their 2018 wedding. Incisive character sketches and a touch of gossip make this admiring biography go down smooth. (Nov.)

                        Best-selling royal biographer Morton (Diana: Her True Story) pens a solid but somewhat lackluster look at the life of Queen Elizabeth II, with 
                        the wistful epilogue completed shortly before her death on September 8, 2022. Morton reminds readers that the longest-reigning monarch in 
                        British history had been a celebrity since she was born, appearing on the cover of Time magazine and postage stamps even before her uncle, 
                        King Edward VIII, abdicated in 1936, making her unexpectedly second in line to the throne. Morton adeptly chronicles the queen's life and 
                        70-year reign since 1952 as she tried "to keep the monarchy relevant, often in the face of resistance from inside the institution itself. Hard-core 
                        royal watchers may learn little new information here, but Morton excels at those small details that show the monarch's personal side, like 
                        when the queen was gleefully photographed informally with her hands in her pockets, something her mother had always discouraged her 
                        from doing. VERDICT Published so soon after the queen's death, Morton's biography will be popular as a new generation of British royals
                         takes the stage.—Denise Miller

                        Having written of the British royal family in numerous other works, notably about the close relationship between the queen and her sister, 
                        Margaret, British journalist Morton writes with reverence about his subject and adds some personal touches to her story. “The queen had 
                        been part of my life forever,” he writes. “Growing up, the queen and her family were like the white cliffs of Dover, immutable, impregnable,
                         there. A fact of life, like breathing.” Composed while she was still alive, the biography was fashioned as a memorial to her unprecedented 
                        70 years on the throne (she acceded upon her father’s death, in 1952, at age 25) as well as her early life. In the preface, Morton offers 
                        glimpses of “the woman behind the mask” (in this case, under the crown), many of which he gleaned during his work as an attending 
                        journalist on her California tour in 1983. He moves chronologically through the fairly well-known facts of Elizabeth’s life, adding 
                        poignant details—e.g., about young Elizabeth’s sensible ways and how she and her sister would gaze out from windows at the crowds 
                        gathered outside, gazing constantly in at her (“both sides wondering what the other was doing”). As the author reminds us, Elizabeth 
                        was not supposed to accede to the throne so early, and he shows readers how her husband, Philip, struggled to adapt to being second 
                        fiddle. “The left-leaning New Statesman magazine,” writes Morton, “hoped that the new monarch, described as ‘capable, energetic, 
                        and sensibly progressive,’ would ‘seize the opportunity to sweep away the old order at court and substitute a way of life that matches
                         the times they live in.’ ” However, scandals among the family concerning Margaret, the queen’s sons, and their wives caused 
                        seemingly irreparable damage to the monarchy until only recently, when William and Kate Middleton rekindled a nostalgia 
                        for the institution.
