                    Donald Trump’s presidency has raised a question that many of us never thought 
                    we’d be asking: Is our democracy in danger? Harvard professors Steven Levitsky 
                    and Daniel Ziblatt have spent more than twenty years studying the breakdown of 
                    democracies in Europe and Latin America, and they believe the answer is yes. 
                    Democracy no longer ends with a bang—in a revolution or military coup—but with 
                    a whimper: the slow, steady weakening of critical institutions, such as the judiciary 
                    and the press, and the gradual erosion of long-standing political norms. The good 
                    news is that there are several exit ramps on the road to authoritarianism. The bad 
                    news is that, by electing Trump, we have already passed the first one.           
                </p>
                <p>
                    Drawing on decades of research and a wide range of historical and global examples, 
                    from 1930s Europe to contemporary Hungary, Turkey, and Venezuela, to the 
                    American South during Jim Crow, Levitsky and Ziblatt show how democracies 
                    die—and how ours can be saved.

                    “What we desperately need is a sober, dispassionate look at the current state of 
                    affairs. Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt, two of the most respected scholars in the 
                    field of democracy studies, offer just that.”—The Washington Post

                <p>
                    “Where Levitsky and Ziblatt make their mark is in weaving together political 
                    science and historical analysis of both domestic and international democratic crises; 
                    in doing so, they expand the conversation beyond Trump and before him, to other 
                    countries and to the deep structure of American democracy and politics.”

                    Levitsky and Ziblatt show how democracies have collapsed elsewhere—not just through violent coups, but more commonly (and insidiously)
                    through a gradual slide into authoritarianism. . . . How Democracies Die is a lucid and essential guide to what can happen here.”

                        Democracies are surprisingly fragile, and their success is not guaranteed. They can be undone deliberately through a coup d’état or 
                        seemingly legally through small steps. This is the message of this audiobook. The moral is to be vigilant and to resist changes in 
                        democratic norms. Fred Sanders offers an evenhanded narration, resisting the temptation to deliver it in a basso profundo voice of 
                        doom or to add false drama. He varies his tone and pacing to suit the material. The authors are academics, but the text is clear and
