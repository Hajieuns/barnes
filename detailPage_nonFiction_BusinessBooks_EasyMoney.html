                    From “one of the crypto industry’s unlikely but most prominent critics” 
                    (Washington Post), an entertaining and well-researched account of the rise and fall

                    At the height of the pandemic, TV star Ben McKenzie was the perfect mark for 
                    cryptocurrency: a dad stuck at home with some cash in his pocket, worried about 
                    his family, armed with only the vague notion that people were making heaps of 
                    money on something he—despite a degree in economics—didn’t entirely understand. 
                    Lured in by grandiose, utopian promises, and sure, a little bit of FOMO, McKenzie 
                    dove deep into blockchain, Bitcoin, and the various other coins and exchanges on 
                    which they are traded. But after scratching the surface, he had to ask, “Am I crazy, 
                    or is this all a total scam?”

                    In Easy Money, McKenzie enlists the help of journalist Jacob Silverman for an 
                    investigative adventure into crypto and its remarkable crash. Weaving together 
                    stories of average traders and victims, colorful crypto “visionaries,” Hollywood’s 
                    biggest true believers, anti-crypto whistleblowers, and government operatives, Easy 
                    Money is an on-the-ground look at a perfect storm of irresponsibility and criminal 
                    fraud. Based on original reporting across the country and abroad, including 
                    interviews with Sam Bankman-Fried, Tether cofounder Brock Pierce, Celsius’s Alex 
                    Mashinsky, and more, this is the book on cryptocurrency you’ve been waiting for.

                    “Crypto is Vegas without the drinks, the dinner, or the show,” contend Gotham actor McKenzie and journalist Silverman (Terms of Service) in 
                    this zippy polemic. McKenzie recounts reading up on crypto during a Covid-induced lull in his acting career and coming to the conclusion that 
                    digital currencies are “akin to gambling” because, unlike shares in a company, crypto is “uncorrelated with any actual asset.” With Silverman, 
                    he examines major players in “one of the greatest frauds in history,” detailing how confidence men around the globe convinced ordinary people 
                    to make misguided investments that were wiped out after the spring 2022 crypto crash. The authors describe El Salvadoran president Nayib 
                    Bukele’s disastrous rollout of a fraud-ridden, government-sponsored platform for exchanging Bitcoin, Sam Bankman-Fried’s illegal strategy 
                    for artificially inflating the size of crypto exchange FTX, and South Korean entrepreneur Do Kwon’s fall from grace after his Luna currency 
                    lost around $40 billion in value over the course of one week in 2022. The crypto-curious will appreciate the authors’ accessible explanations 
                    of how digital currencies work, and the profiles illuminate how hype and irresponsible business practices inflated the crypto bubble for years 
                    before its inevitable burst. The result is a damning study of how and why the crypto market collapsed. (July)

                        Actor McKenzie continues his long-standing denunciation of cryptocurrency.

                        Matt Damon hawked crypto in ads during NFL games. Kim Kardashian made such extraordinary claims for it that it drew the attention of 
                        British regulators—though, in the U.S., “Kardashian’s promotion was initially met with typical regulatory silence.” Crypto seemed to be 
                        just the thing for the rich and powerful, a means of hiding transactions via the secrecy associated with a financial instrument that isn’t
                         really a currency, at least by American law. Writing with financial journalist Silverman, McKenzie charges that since crypto behaves like
                         a security, and an unregulated one at that, its price “jumps up and down like a rabbit on amphetamines.” Furthermore, the technology 
                        doesn’t scale well enough, it’s environmentally disastrous because it requires so much electricity to “mine,” and it’s surrounded by 
                        “fraudsters” and “con men.” Ethereum, founded in 2015 and the “second largest cryptocurrency as of this writing,” appears to be a
                         smoke-and-mirrors operation, while Tether “was as if a random group of middling ne’er-do-wells had been issued their own money 
                        printer,” a bomb waiting to take down the entire system of casino capitalism. The author chronicles how some of the less cautious 
                        principals were taken down by international police forces, while others simply disappeared after their businesses evaporated—but not,
                         he adds, before a few of them bought yachts. As for Kardashian, she was “fined $1.26 million by the SEC for her participation in 
                        shilling the shitcoin Ethereum Max”—even if she was just a willing tool and not herself a fraudster. “Would anyone in crypto ever see 
                        the inside of a jail cell?” asks McKenzie. At least since the author finished the book, it appears that at least one or two—
                        Sam Bankman-Fried most notable among them—are on the way to the slammer.
