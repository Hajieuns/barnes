                    dreadfully delightful fantasy will hook its claws in you from the first page and 
                    never let go. Jude is one of the best protagonists in YA Fantasy, and The Cruel 
                    Prince will show you why.       
                </p>
                <p class="bold">
                    By #1 New York Times bestselling author Holly Black, the first book in a stunning 
                    new series about a mortal girl who finds herself caught in a web of royal faerie 
                    intrigue.      
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course I want to be like them. They're beautiful as blades forged in some divine 
                    fire. They will live forever.          
                </p>
                <p>
                    And Cardan is even more beautiful than the rest. I hate him more than all the others. 
                    I hate him so much that sometimes when I look at him, I can hardly breathe.             
                </p>

                    Jude was seven years old when her parents were murdered and she and her two 
                    sisters were stolen away to live in the treacherous High Court of Faerie. Ten years 
                    later, Jude wants nothing more than to belong there, despite her mortality. But 
                    many of the fey despise humans. Especially Prince Cardan, the youngest and 
                    wickedest son of the High King.            
                </p>
                <p>
                    To win a place at the Court, she must defy him—and face the consequences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In doing so, she becomes embroiled in palace intrigues and deceptions, discovering 
                    her own capacity for bloodshed. But as civil war threatens to drown the Courts of 
                    Faerie in violence, Jude will need to risk her life in a dangerous alliance to save her 
                    sisters, and Faerie itself.

                        Black is a master at world-building, conveying integral details without that information ever seeming tedious or encyclopedic, whether you're 
                        well versed in faerie or a newcomer to the genre. It's an especially neat trick because the experience of reading a novel like this is something 
                        like being surrounded by magic. Jude, who possesses just enough badness that you really root for her…will have fans eager to follow her.

                        When Jude Duarte was seven, she watched Madoc, general to the high king of Elfhame, slaughter her parents. Madoc then dragged 
                        Jude and her two sisters off to Faerieland, where he raised them as his own. Ten years later, Jude remains an outcast who is cruelly 
                        bullied by the other children of Faerie—the king’s youngest son, Prince Cardan, chief among them. Jude dreams of becoming a member
                         of the High Court and the power that it confers, so when the opportunity arises for her to enter into the service of one of Cardan’s 
                        brothers, she seizes it, inadvertently placing herself at the center of a bloody coup and endangering the lives of everyone she loves. First
                         in a trilogy, this spellbinding fantasy from Black (The Darkest Part of the Forest) reflects on the cost of ambition and explores the 
                        bomb-strewn border between love and hate. Breathtaking set pieces, fully developed supporting characters, and a beguiling, tough-as-nails
                         heroine enhance an intricate, intelligent plot that crescendos to a jaw-dropping third-act twist. Ages 15–up. Agent: Barry Goldblatt,

                        Gr 9 Up—Human Jude has been raised along with her twin, Taryn, and half-sibling, Vivi, in Faerieland by Madoc, the faerie who murdered her parents.
                        This intricate realm is filled with beautiful, blood-thirsty, playful, and powerful faeries who seem to have no patience or use for humans beyond
                        enslaving them with magic. Despite this, Jude is determined to earn respect and a place in it all by becoming a knight. First in a planned trilogy,
                        this YA fantasy features a political scramble reminiscent of Game of Thrones, with spies, manipulation, romance, swordplay, betrayal, and an 
                       intoxicating darkness that manages to enrapture Jude and readers. Black has created a brutal and captivating world, filled with complex characters
                        and their intricate and layered relationships. Jude is a mighty heroine; strong, smart, cunning, and yet completely vulnerable. Teens meet her as she's
                        no longer interested in restraining her emotions and actions and is willing to give up anything in order to work for what she wants, which makes
                        for a powerful and dangerous damsel getting herself out of distress. VERDICT Another fantastic, deeply engaging, and all-consuming work from

                        In this series opener, narrator Caitlin Kelly perfectly crafts the fierce and determined voice of 17-year-old Jude, a human who is desperately trying to
                        fit into the faerie world despite having arrived against her will and under dire circumstances. When the opportunity to become a spy for one of the 
                       princes comes to pass, she’s finally given a chance to take control of her life and find her place. Kelly smoothly transitions from one character to the 
                       next, creating energized dialogue that reflects the drama of the story. Listeners will be enchanted by Jude and her fantastical world of fast-paced

                        Black is back with another dark tale of Faerie, this one set in Faerie and launching a new trilogy.Jude—broken, rebuilt, fueled by anger and a 
                        sense of powerlessness—has never recovered from watching her adoptive Faerie father murder her parents. Human Jude (whose brown hair curls 
                        and whose skin color is never described) both hates and loves Madoc, whose murderous nature is true to his Faerie self and who in his way loves
                         her. Brought up among the Gentry, Jude has never felt at ease, but after a decade, Faerie has become her home despite the constant peril. Black's
                         latest looks at nature and nurture and spins a tale of court intrigue, bloodshed, and a truly messed-up relationship that might be the saving of Jude 
                        and the titular prince, who, like Jude, has been shaped by the cruelties of others. Fierce and observant Jude is utterly unaware of the currents that 
                        swirl around her. She fights, plots, even murders enemies, but she must also navigate her relationship with her complex family (human, Faerie, and 
                        mixed). This is a heady blend of Faerie lore, high fantasy, and high school drama, dripping with description that brings the dangerous but tempting
                         world of Faerie to life.Black is building a complex mythology; now is a great time to tune in. (Fantasy. 14-adult)
