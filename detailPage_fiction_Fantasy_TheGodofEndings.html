                <p>
                    Now, almost 150 years later, Collette is a lonely artist running an elite fine art 
                    school for children in upstate New York. But her life is suddenly upended by the 
                    arrival of a gifted child from a troubled home, the return of a stalking presence 
                    from her past, and her own mysteriously growing hunger for blood.

                    Combining brilliant prose with breathtaking suspense, Jacqueline Holland's The 
                    God of Endings serves as a larger exploration of the human condition in all its 
                    complexity, asking us the most fundamental question: is life in this world a gift 
                    or a curse?

                    Holland debuts with a reflective and poetic take on the nature of immortality. Ana, a young girl in the 1830s, watches her family and the rest 
                    of her village succumb to tuberculosis without knowing what’s happening. Before the disease can take her, too, an older gentleman claiming to 
                    be her grandfather arrives to whisk her away. At the moment of her death, he decides her life is worth saving and changes her into a vampire 
                    like himself. Ana slowly learns to survive in this new form—and watches everyone around her die in the process. A century-and-a-half later, Ana 
                    has taken the new name of Collette and travels to her grandfather’s country estate at his request, as he’s in need of a caretaker. She’s happy 
                    enough running a preschool for the rich out of the mansion until her hunger grows suddenly insatiable and nightmares from her past reappear. 
                    Holland’s refreshing vampires lean philosophical as they struggle with immense grief and loneliness. The intrinsic magic of her worldbuilding, 
                    meanwhile, creates a consistent feeling of mystery. The result will especially wow fans of Katherine Arden and Sophie Anderson. Agent: Jennifer

                        "What begins as a traditional vampire tale, satisfyingly taking in both New England and Eastern European lore, soon morphs into a wartime romance, 
                        and then again into a psychological thriller in the modern, 80s-set story strand, in which Collette runs a preschool for privileged children... Holland has 
                        been praised for her lush prose, but ornamentation never gets in the way of a propulsive story, nor obscures the truly terrible possibilities of existence 
                        without end."

                        "With her debut, Holland has carved her name on the wall of authors whose work obliterates any discussion of literary fiction versus genre fiction 
                        because it is both. To produce a first novel that joins the ranks of writers such as Carmen Maria Machado, Silvia Moreno-Garcia, Brian Evenson, 
                        and Stephen Graham Jones, to name a few, is a superb accomplishment—and one that should make everyone excited about whatever Holland 
                        publishes next."

                        "An atmospheric vampire tale that wrestles with existential questions of being and philosophy rather than bloodlust and gore, The God of Endings 
                        is a dark, beautifully written story about what it means to live forever, and the grief and loneliness that walk hand in hand with immortality. Slow-
                        moving and occasionally quite grisly, Jacquelin Holland’s debut weaves elements of Slavic folklore throughout her thoroughly modern exploration 
                        of the search for meaning in a world where, for central character Collette, everything inevitably fades away."

                        "Holland challenges the ways that we tell stories about ourselves. In doing so, she has infused the vampire novel with new blood. The God of
                        Endings becomes a meditation on the ways that eternal life requires a constant reckoning with the sins of the mortal."

                        punch at the end of the novel that both questions and affirms the nature of life and human existence.... Let’s hope that [this] is just the beginning

                        and the paradoxical fragility and endurance of love. It raises powerful and thought-provoking questions about motherhood, and how to live, and 
                        the ending will stay with me for a long time in the best possible way."

                        DEBUT Collette is the daughter of a gravestone carver in 1830s New York. All around her is death and mourning as disease tears families 
                        apart, and it's coming to consume her. As Collette takes her final breath, her mysterious grandfather saves her by turning her immortal, but 
                        this may turn out to be more curse than blessing. The novel jumps between Collette's past and her present in 1984, where she runs an elite 
                        preschool teaching the arts. Her loneliness, however, seems to be catching up with her, causing her to curse her immortality, as she has watched 
                        the god of endings take so many loved ones. Her hunger for blood has become ravenous, and smells of smoke and ash plague her. The god of 
                        endings seems to be coming once again; what will he take this time? VERDICT Holland's well-crafted debut features atmospheric prose and 
                        excellent character development. Great for fans of Anne Rice's Interview with a Vampire and V. E. Schwab's The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue.

                        Following a vampire across more than 200 years, this novel considers “whether this world and life in it is a kindness or an unkindness,

                        At the age of 10, Anna faces illness and death daily as an epidemic sweeps through her town. After the deaths of her father and brother, and 
                        when she's at her sickest, her grandfather arrives. Just as she’s about to succumb to the illness that killed her whole family, he transforms her 
                        into a vampire like himself. When she asks him why he did it, he replies: “This world, my dear child, all of it, right to the very end if there is to 
                        be an end, is a gift. But it’s a gift few are strong enough to receive. I made a judgment that you might be among those strong few, that you might be 
                        better served on this side of things than the other. I thought you might find some use for the world, and it for you.” The years that follow are difficult 
                        and often wrought with loss for Anna. She lives many lives over the centuries and eventually takes on the name Collette LaSange, opening a French 
                        preschool in Millstream Hollow, New York. Chapters alternate between Anna’s life beginning in the 1830s and her current life in 1984 as Collette. 
                        Notable points of tension arise when Collette tries unsuccessfully to sate her hunger, which is becoming increasingly unbearable, and as her interest in 
                        the artistic growth of a student named Leo deepens. Through decadently vivid prose—which could have been streamlined at times—this hefty novel 
                        meditates on major themes such as life, love, and death with exceptional acumen. The final questions in the book—“How presumptuous is the gift of 
                        life? What arrogance is implicit in the act of love that calls another into existence?”—serve as an anchor to meditations on these themes found throughout.

                        Narrator Saskia Maarleveld takes listeners through the storied life of a vampire who is struggling to make sense of her long existence. Collette LeSange 
                        lives a quiet life as an elite fine arts teacher of children in 1984 New York--until a young boy from a troubled home upsets her careful routine. 
                        Reflecting on the traumatic experiences of her own life, she tries to avoid the ending that seems to be pursuing her and her young charge. 
                        Maarleveld's narration takes the exquisite prose of this story and elevates it to a lyrical listening experience. Her consistently skilled delivery 
                        moves through a variety of accents and time periods. This audiobook is a fascinating story told by a masterful performer.
