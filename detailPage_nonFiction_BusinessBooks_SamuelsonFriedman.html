                    From the author of Keynes Hayek, the next great duel in the history of economics.
                    In 1966 two columnists joined Newsweek magazine. Their assignment: debate the 
                    world of business and economics. Paul Samuelson was a towering figure in 
                    Keynesian economics, which supported the management of the economy along lines 
                    prescribed by John Maynard Keynes’s General Theory. Milton Friedman, little 
                    known at that time outside of conservative academic circles, championed 
                    “monetarism” and insisted the Federal Reserve maintain tight control over the 
                    amount of money circulating in the economy.         
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Samuelson Friedman, author and journalist Nicholas Wapshott brings narrative 
                    verve and puckish charm to the story of these two giants of modern economics, their 
                    braided lives and colossal intellectual battles.       
                </p>
                <p>
                    Samuelson, a forbidding technical genius, grew up a child of relative privilege and 
                    went on to revolutionize macroeconomics. He wrote the best-selling economics 
                    textbook of all time, famously remarking "I don’t care who writes a nation’s laws—
                    or crafts its advanced treatises—if I can write its economics textbooks." His friend 
                    and adversary for decades, Milton Friedman, studied the Great Depression and with 
                    Anna Schwartz wrote the seminal books The Great Contraction and A Monetary 
                    History of the United States. Like Friedrich Hayek before him, Friedman found 
                    fortune writing a treatise, Capitalism and Freedom, that yoked free markets and 
                    libertarian politics in a potent argument that remains a lodestar for economic 
                    conservatives today.        
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Wapshott’s nimble hands, Samuelson and Friedman’s decades-long argument 
                    over how—or whether—to manage the economy becomes a window onto one of the 
                    longest periods of economic turmoil in the United States. As the soaring economy of 
                    the 1950s gave way to decades stalked by declining prosperity and "stagflation," it 
                    was a time when the theory and practice of economics became the preoccupation of 
                    politicians and the focus of national debate. It is an argument that continues today.

                    Journalist Wapshott (Keynes Hayek) returns with another lucid and character-driven account of the rivalry between two leading economists. 
                    From 1966 to 1981, MIT professor Paul Samuelson, author of a popular Keynesian economics textbook, and Milton Friedman, a leader of 
                    the conservative Chicago school of economics, debated their differences of opinion in a series of alternating columns for Newsweek. Wapshott 
                    details the “generosity and civility” Samuelson and Friedman showed each other, and chronicles the waning of Keynesian economics as the U.S. 
                    confronted “stagflation” (high inflation coupled with stagnant economic growth) in the 1970s. Friedman was a “street fighter” eager to see his 
                    monetarist theories put into practice, while the more moderate Samuelson attempted to synthesize Keynesian economics and the free market 
                    principles of the Chicago school. Both men won the Nobel prize, but Wapshott contends that the Great Recession primarily vindicated 
                    Samuelson and “shook the commonly held belief that free-market forces, left to their own devices, would act to ensure the perpetual prosperity, 
                    full employment, and growth that Americans demanded.” Wapshott briskly explains the underlying economic theories and enlivens his account 
                    with cultural history and colorful character sketches. The result is an accessible and nuanced introduction to two of the most influential 
                    economists of the 20th century. (June)

                        "Summarising the debate between the two most important economists of the second half of the 20th century may seem like a monumental task, 
                        best consigned to specialist textbooks. But this brave history of the intellectual dual between Paul Samuelson and Milton Friedman proves that 
                        assumption wrong, with its focus as much on their lives as on their ideas."

                        Two Economists Go to War - Literary Review - Zareer Masani
                        "If you had to name the two most influential economists of the postwar decades, you would not go far wrong if you picked Paul Samuelson and
                         Milton Friedman… As Wapshott shows, their arguments over the proper scope of government intervention and the 
                        control of inflation echo down to the present."

                        Samuelson and Friedman — a rivalry that echoes down to the present - Financial Times - Adam Tooze
                        "This is a follow-up to the author’s Keynes Hayek. Its focus is with the debate between MIT’s Paul Samuelson and Chicago’s MiltonFriedman, 
                        whose contrasting views graced the pages of Newsweek for 18 years. Samuelson was an economist’s economist: his methodological influence 
                        was profound. Friedman had a huge influence on monetary economics. But his political influence was arguably even greater. By focusing on 
                        these two men, Wapshott illuminates debates that remain current to this day."

                        The author of a previous pairing of the intellectual forebears of his present subjects—John Maynard Keynes and Friedrich Hayek
                        —Wapshott recounts the rise to prominence of Paul Samuelson (1915-2009) and his ideological counterpart, Milton Friedman (1912-2006).
                         Both grew up under similar circumstances, the worldly children of Jewish immigrants, and both arrived at a nearly opposite view of 
                        economics, particularly as an instrument of politics. The two were well aware of each other when Newsweek hired both to write an 
                        alternating column on economics. Samuelson originally declined, having earned a substantial income from his textbook on economics, 
                        which remained a standard into the 1970s. Finally, he relented after being paid the modern equivalent of $98,600 for a mere 17 pieces.
                         “Finding an articulate, young economist who would counter Samuelson’s viewpoint would not be easy,” writes Wapshott, but finally 
                        Newsweek brought Friedman on board. By then, Friedman had already laid out the bare bones of modern libertarianism, which holds 
                        that the free market regulates itself and government has little if any role in it, or indeed in daily life. Samuelson, meanwhile, was an 
                        exponent of the quantitative easing and other interventions that Keynes had brought to bear on the Depression. The two remained
                         grudgingly admiring rivals for five decades. Though Samuelson considered Keynes the greatest economist in history, alongside Adam 
                        Smith and Léon Walras, Friedman remained convinced that “all attempts to temper the market, however well intended…were doomed 
                        because they hampered the efficient operation of capitalism, which, when left to its own devices, was sure to maximize the benefits to 
                        society.” Though Friedman’s libertarianism remains influential, particularly among conservatives, it is not unalloyed: He favored
                         legalizing drugs and diminishing the military, for instance. Samuelson’s view was tested and found largely correct, though, with the
                         Great Recession of 2008, when, as a British newspaper put it, “it was Samuelson’s prescriptions, rather than Friedman’s, that carried the day.”
