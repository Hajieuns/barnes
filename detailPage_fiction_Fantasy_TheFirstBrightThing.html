                    Ringmaster — Rin, to those who know her best — can jump to different moments 
                    in time as easily as her wife, Odette, soars from bar to bar on the trapeze. And the

                <p>
                    With the world still reeling from World War I, Rin and her troupe — the Circus of 
                    the Fantasticals — travel the midwest, offering a single night of enchantment and 
                    respite to all who step into their Big Top.           
                </p>
                <p>
                    But threats come at Rin from all sides. The future holds an impending war that the 
                    Sparks can see barrelling toward their show and everyone in it. And Rin's past 
                    creeps closer every day, a malevolent shadow she can’t fully escape.

                    It takes the form of another circus, with tents as black as midnight and a ringmaster 
                    who rules over his troupe with a dangerous power. Rin's circus has something he 
                    wants, and he won't stop until it's his.

                    The scars of the past make themselves known in Dawson’s debut, an uplifting historical time-travel fantasy. In an alternate-1920s America, 
                    Sparks, people gifted with unique powers, are shunned and feared by wider society. Rin, also known as Ringmaster, travels the American 
                    Midwest with her Spark circus, teleporting from city to city and decade to decade, while also fleeing from her husband, the Circus King, 
                    who used his own dangerous Spark to keep Rin chained in a coercive relationship. As Rin and the Circus King circle each other and the 
                    threat of WWII looms, Rin and her chosen family learn that, though some evils are too great for one person to vanquish alone, there is 
                    unexpected power in small gestures of courage. Dawson’s exploration of survival and healing forms the story’s emotional core but an 
                    abundance of wholesome and occasionally saccharine platitudes (“When we hurt ourselves, we hurt those around us”; “True courage 
                    comes when there is nothing we can do to stop the darkness, but we still hold the torch for those who must walk the hardest paths”) 
                    undermines the narrative’s power. Still, fans of gentle, uplifting speculative fiction will find much to enjoy in this heartfelt celebration 
                    of difference. (June)

                        DEBUT The Circus of the Fantasticals always arrives at the right place at the right time, for those in the circus are Sparks, people with 
                        extraordinary powers. The Ringmaster, "Rin," can jump to different moments in time, and she, her trapeze artist wife Odette, and others
                         have created the circus as a home and haven for Sparks who are persecuted and despised for their differences. The future looks grim, despite 
                        the moments in time that Rin, Odette, and their financier (and future seer) Mauve try to change. Rin's past also casts a long shadow, one of 
                        black tents, danger, and the whispers of a man whom Rin thought she had escaped. The Circus King also follows them, and his power can 
                        net anything he wants—and he wants Rin. Dawson's debut is haunting, employing themes of gaslighting, trauma, and war, which are woven 
                        through dual points of view and multiple timelines. Judaism plays a role as well, both in the faith of the characters and through parallels of 
                        persecution. VERDICT Dawson mashes up history, fantasy, and the magic of the circus in an emotionally immersive, character-driven story.

                        With earnestness that matches the author's poignant story, narrator Petrea Burchard introduces listeners to the Circus of the Fantasticals. 
                        In the 1920s they are a magical band of friends, lovers, and misfits, including a soaring trapeze artist, the Calliope Man, and a woman who 
                        can burst into flames. They are led by a time-traveling ringmaster named Rin. As Rin discovers that a truly calamitous event--WWII--is on 
                        the horizon, she realizes she must battle the Circus King, whose shadowy backstory is delivered in a fine British accent and urgent tone by 
                        narrator Tim Campbell. The audiobook shifts from fantasy to horror when Rin inspires her circus performers to use their magic wisely as 
                        a dark future descends on the world. B.P. © AudioFile 2023, Portland, Maine
