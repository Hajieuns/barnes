                        novel of striking emotional intensity. Complex and introspective Shadi details her experiences with the specific challenges 
                        of Islamaphobia and with more general issues. With masterfully compelling prose, this surprises and ensnares, leading readers to an inevitable but gripping
                         climax. Though there's a feverous feeling throughout the book, there's also formidable nuance in Shadi’s paradoxical and contradictory 
                        thought patterns, which add even more to the blunt realism. Emotional implications of great magnitude and stakes that could not feel higher.
                         A bluntly powerful read that shouldn't be missed."

                        Gr 9 Up—Mafi's new high fantasy series has roots in Islamic tradition and the Persian epic Shahnameh, giving
                        fairy-tale vibes to a star-crossed romance. A treaty has ended the brutal wars between Jinn and humankind, but it leaves the Jinn persecuted and oppressed.
                        Any use of a Jinn's innate magic earns them a death sentence, but Alizeh's magic is especially treacherous: 
                       in her veins runs the ice of the royal line, marking her the queen of their lost kingdom. Kamran, the crown prince, has dedicated
                        his life to the empire and becoming a just ruler, trying to parse the prophecies about the death of the king. When Kamran and Alizeh run into each o
                       ther, they're immediately captivated. Even knowing the dangers they face can't make them ignore the pull of their hearts, 
                       setting the stage for a violent upheaval not just of their lives, but of the world. Mafi's intricate worldbuilding sets high stakes 
                       for the trilogy. The setting grapples with themes of discrimination and equity versus equality as the Jinn are forced to make themselves less in order to keep 
                       from outshining 
                       their human neighbors. Mafi's exposition-heavy style won't appeal to all readers; while her writing is beautiful, it does weigh down the pacing as much as 
                       it amplifies the angst-filled romance. The majority of the cast is olive-skinned. VERDICT Hand this one to fans of Sabaa Tahir's An Ember in the Ashes.
                        Mafi's slow-build story is braiding a complex plot that promises a payoff in the sequels.—Emmy Neal

                        Ever since the fall of Iblees, a Jinn and being of fire who rebelled against God’s creation of humans, all Jinn-kind have been forsaken by a universe 
                        that bore witness to the fall of their civilization and humanity’s inheritance of the world. Though the kingdom of Ardunia’s Fire Accords established
                         a tenuous peace between the two races, ingrained hatred for those associated with the devil resulted in the exploitation of Jinn and curtailing of 
                        their abilities. Alizeh, a Jinn working as a servant in a noble house, hopes for a reprieve from her state of destitution, grief over her parents’ deaths,
                         and flight from constant persecution. Because in addition to being Jinn, ice also runs through Alizeh’s blood, marking her as the heir to a lost 
                        kingdom whose power will lead to the unification and liberation of her people. When Prince Kamran discovers Alizeh, he cannot deny his 
                        attraction to her, even as her very existence threatens his grandfather, the king; the continuity of Ardunia; and perhaps humanity itself. Alizeh 
                        agonizes over her own feelings for the prince and the implications of the prophecy while she navigates between those who see her as an enemy
                         and those who wish to use her. Richly textured, descriptive prose coupled with agonizing romance combine in this fantastical epic.
