                    An ode to Put the Damn Guns Down, this is New York Times bestselling author 
                    Jason Reynolds’s electrifying novel that takes place in sixty potent seconds—the 
                    time it takes a kid to decide whether or not he’s going to murder the guy who killed 
                    his brother.     
                </p>

                <p>
                    Or, you can call it a gun. That’s what fifteen-year-old Will has shoved in the back 
                    waistband of his jeans. See, his brother Shawn was just murdered. And Will knows 
                    the rules. No crying. No snitching. Revenge. That’s where Will’s now heading, with
                     that gun shoved in the back waistband of his jeans, the gun that was his brother’s 
                    gun. He gets on the elevator, seventh floor, stoked. He knows who he’s after. Or 
                    does he?           
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the elevator stops on the sixth floor, on comes Buck. Buck, Will finds out, is who 
                    gave Shawn the gun before Will took the gun. Buck tells Will to check that the gun 
                    is even loaded. And that’s when Will sees that one bullet is missing. And the only one 
                    who could have fired Shawn’s gun was Shawn. Huh. Will didn’t know that Shawn 
                    had ever actually USED his gun. Bigger huh. BUCK IS DEAD. But Buck’s in the 
                    elevator?          
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just as Will’s trying to think this through, the door to the next floor opens. A 
                    teenage girl gets on, waves away the smoke from Dead Buck’s cigarette. Will doesn’t 
                    know her, but she knew him. Knew. When they were eight. And stray bullets had 
                    cut through the playground, and Will had tried to cover her, but she was hit anyway, 
                    and so what she wants to know, on that fifth floor elevator stop, is, what if Will, 
                    Will with the gun shoved in the back waistband of his jeans, MISSES.       
                </p>
                <p>
                    And so it goes, the whole long way down, as the elevator stops on each floor, and at 
                    each stop someone connected to his brother gets on to give Will a piece to a bigger 
                    story than the one he thinks he knows. A story that might never know an END...
                    if Will gets off that elevator.

                    Told in short, fierce staccato narrative verse, Long Way Down is a fast and furious, 
                    dazzlingly brilliant look at teenage gun violence, as could only be told by Jason 
                    Reynolds.

                    Will, 15, is following his neighborhood’s well-established rules—don’t cry, don’t snitch, but do get revenge “if someone you love/ gets killed”
                    —when he leaves his apartment, intent on killing whoever murdered his older brother, Shawn. He’s emboldened by the gun tucked into his 
                    waistband: “I put my hand behind my back/ felt the imprint/ of the piece, like/ another piece/ of me/ an extra vertebra,/ some more/ backbone.” 
                    As Will makes his way to the ground floor of his building, the elevator stops to accept passengers, each an important figure from his past, all 
                    victims of gun violence. Are these ghosts? Or is it Will’s subconscious at work, forcing him to think about what he intends to do and what it
                     will accomplish? The story unfolds in the time it takes for the elevator to descend, and it ends with a two-word question that hits like a punch 
                    to the gut. Written entirely in spare verse, this is a tour de force from a writer who continues to demonstrate his skill as an exceptionally 
                    perceptive chronicler of what it means to be a black teen in America. Ages 12–up. Agent: Elena Giovinazzo, Pippin Properties. (Oct.)

                        The newest work for teens by Jason Reynolds (author of As Brave As You and Ghost, and 2017 Indies First spokesperson) begins with 15-year-old 
                        William speaking directly to the reader: "I haven't/ told nobody the story/ I'm about to tell you./ And truth is, you probably ain't/ gon' believe it 
                        either/ gon' think I'm lying/ or I'm losing it,/ but I'm telling you,/ this story is true."

                        The day before yesterday, Will's older brother, Shawn, went to the other side of their largely black neighborhood—purportedly crossing rival lines—
                        to get their mother special soap for her eczema. Shortly after Shawn left, Will and his friend, who were talking outside, heard shots. They 
                        immediately did what they had been trained to do: "Pressed our lips to the/ pavement and prayed/ the boom, followed by/ the buzz of a bullet,
                        / ain't meet us."      
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        Afterward, Will says, "me and Tony/ waited like we always do,/ for the rumble to stop,/ before picking our heads up/ and poking our heads out/ to 
                        count the bodies./ This time/ there was only one": Shawn. "[I]f the blood/ inside you," Will tells the reader, "is on the inside/ of someone else/ 
                        you never want to/ see it on the outside of/ them."       
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        Now, two days later, Will is heartbroken and desperate as he abides by "The Rules" he's been taught all of his life; he won't cry and he won't snitch. 
                        And, most importantly, he plans to follow through with the third rule: "if someone you love/ gets killed,/ find the person/ who killed/ them and/ kill 
                        them." He finds a gun in Shawn's dresser—one bullet under a full clip—and sets off to kill the person who killed his brother.

                    <span>
                        With the gun tucked into the waistband of his pants, Will gets on the elevator at 9:08:02 a.m. The next 200-plus pages of action take place between the
                        time Will enters the elevator and when it reaches the lobby a moment later, at 9:09:09 a.m. As Will takes the long trip down, a new person boards at 
                       every floor. Each new person is a friend or loved one from Will's past; each new person is dead, a victim of gun violence.

                    <span>
                        As the ghosts of those killed congregate in the elevator to tell Will their stories, their interconnected tales are untangled and Will begins to see how the 
                        things he thinks he knows may not be true at all, and that The Rules just perpetuate the cycle of violence and keep everyone down.

                    <span>
                        Will's trip between floors and through time is powerful and painful. Reynolds's work is rich with symbolism, the verse lending a feeling of immediacy
                        to the 300-page, 60-second journey. Long Way Down is an intense read with a beautifully ambiguous ending that highlights the humanity of those
                        who are regularly touched by and contribute to gun violence. —Siân Gaetano, children's and YA editor, Shelf Awareness

                        In this free-verse novel, it’s been fewer than two days since narrator Will witnessed the shooting death of his older brother, Shawn. Now, according to 
                        the “rules” passed from father to son, brother to brother, revenge is the next order of business, and Carlon Riggs, a member of the Dark Suns gang, is
                         in Will’s crosshairs. Taking the gun jammed into Shawn’s dresser, Will heads to the elevator on the seventh floor of his apartment building and 
                        presses the “L” button (which he and Shawn used to pretend stood for “loser” rather than “lobby”) at 9:08:02 am. Before he reaches the lobby at
                         9:09:09, six ghosts will enter the elevator—victims, perpetrators, or both, entangled in a chain of murder, misidentification, and revenge that led 
                        to Shawn’s death; together they challenge Will’s perspective on the killing and on his role in vigilante justice. The ghosts all know one another as 
                        confederates in death, and all history that might have once made them enemies is now overshadowed by their detachment from mortal issues; they
                         can share cigarettes and a mildly sardonic view of the absurdity of their collective backstory. The spirits, particularly Will’s uncle, father, and brother,
                         have Will’s interest at heart; they won’t tell Will what to do, but they break through his anger and pride and point him to a place where he can allow
                         himself to grieve and reconsider. Will’s voice emerges through free-verse poems that are arresting in their imagery and convincing in their 
                        conversational cadence. Gripping and lightning fast, this will be a strong recommendation for discussion, particularly within groups of varied 
                        reading interests and abilities.

                        Spanning a mere one minute and seven seconds, Reynolds’ new free-verse novel is an intense snapshot of the chain reaction caused by pulling a trigger. 
                        First, 15-year-old Will Holloman sets the scene by relating his brother’s, Shawn’s, murder two days prior—gunned down while buying soap for their 
                        mother. Next, he lays out The Rules: don’t cry, don’t snitch, always get revenge. Now that the reader is up to speed, Will tucks Shawn’s gun into his
                         waistband and steps into an elevator, steeled to execute rule number three and shoot his brother’s killer. Yet, the simple seven-floor descent becomes 
                        a revelatory trip. At each floor, the doors open to admit someone killed by the same cycle of violence that Will’s about to enter. He’s properly freaked
                         out, but as the seconds tick by and floors count down, each new occupant drops some knowledge and pushes Will to examine his plans for that gun.
                         Reynolds’ concise verses echo like shots against the white space of the page, their impact resounding. He peels back the individual stories that led to 
                        this moment in the elevator and exposes a culture inured to violence because poverty, gang life, or injustice has left them with no other option. In this
                         all too real portrait of survival, Reynolds goes toe-to-toe with where, or even if, love and choice are allowed to exist. HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY:
                         A noisy buzz always surrounds this critically acclaimed author’s work, and the planned tour and promo campaign will boost this book’s to a siren call.

                        Fifteen-year-old Will, immobilized with grief when his older brother Shawn is
                        shot and killed, slowly comes to mull The Rules in his head. There are three: don’t
                        cry, don’t snitch, and “if someone you love / gets killed, / find the person / who
                        killed / them and / kill them.” So Will locates Shawn’s gun, leaves his family’s
                        eighth-floor apartment, and—well, here is where this intense verse novel becomes
                        a gripping drama, as on each floor of the descending elevator Will is joined by yet
                        another victim or perpetrator in the chain of violence that took his brother’s life.
                        Shawn’s best friend Buck gets into the elevator on seven; Dani, Will’s friend from
                        childhood, gets in on six; Will and Shawn’s uncle Mark gets in on five, in a cloud
                        of cigarette smoke. And so it goes, each stop of the elevator adding to the chorus
                        of ghosts (including Will and Shawn’s father), each one with his or her perspective
                        on The Rules. The poetry is stark, fluently using line breaks and page-turns for
                        dramatic effect; the last of these reveals the best closing line of a novel this season.
                        Read alone (though best aloud), the novel is a high-stakes moral thriller; it’s also a
                        perfect if daring choice for readers’ theater.

                        Gr 8 Up—Fifteen-year-old Will's big brother has been shot and killed. According to the rules that Will has been taught, it is now his job to kill the 
                        person responsible. He easily finds his brother's gun and gets on the elevator to head down from his eighth-floor apartment. But it's a long way down
                         to the ground floor. At each floor, a different person gets on to tell a story. Each of these people is already dead. As they relate their tales, readers 
                        learn about the cycle of violence in which Will is caught up. The protagonist faces a difficult choice, one that is a reality for many young people. 
                        Teens are left with an unresolved ending that goes beyond the simple question of whether Will will seek revenge. Told in verse, this title is fabulistic 
                        in its simplicity and begs to be discussed. Its hook makes for an excellent booktalk. It will pair well with Angie Thomas's The Hate U Give and 
                        Reynolds's previous works. The unique narrative structure also makes it an excellent read-alike for Walter Dean Myers's Monster. VERDICT This
                         powerful work is an important addition to any collection.—Kristin Anderson, Columbus Metropolitan Library System, OH

                        This novel in verse, made to be read aloud, makes a compelling case for gun control. Its potency is increased by the narration of author Jason Reynolds, 
                        which buoys listeners through the intense linked stories. Three poems into Will Holloman’s first-person narrative, one learns about his brother. Shawn 
                        is funny, tells stupid jokes, and “was shot . . . and killed.” Reynolds excels at delivering dramatic pauses in the short poems, which are packed with 
                        sensory details and emotions that anchor listeners even as they stun with painful beauty. Will enters a mystical elevator, a gun sticking out of his pants 
                        like a “steel tail,” his grief mixed with a desire for vengeance. As if the raw poignancy isn’t enough, Reynolds’s rich voice transports listeners to a 
                        strange reality in which Will is transformed by those from his past who have been killed by the very kind of violent act he is contemplating.

                         funny, tells stupid jokes, and “was shot . . . and killed.” Reynolds excels at delivering dramatic pauses in the short poems, which are packed with sensory
                         details and emotions that anchor listeners even as they stun with painful beauty. Will enters a mystical elevator, a gun sticking out of his pants like a “steel 
                        tail,” his grief mixed with a desire for vengeance. As if the raw poignancy isn’t enough, Reynolds’s rich voice transports listeners to a strange reality in 
                        which Will is transformed by those from his past who have been killed by the very kind of violent act he is contemplating. S.W. Winner of AudioFile

                        After 15-year-old Will sees his older brother, Shawn, gunned down on the streets, he sets out to do the expected: the rules dictate no crying, no snitching, 
                        and revenge. Though the African-American teen has never held one, Will leaves his apartment with his brother's gun tucked in his waistband. As he travels 
                        down on the elevator, the door opens on certain floors, and Will is confronted with a different figure from his past, each a victim of gun violence, each 
                        important in his life. They also force Will to face the questions he has about his plan. As each "ghost" speaks, Will realizes how much of his own story 
                        has been unknown to him and how intricately woven they are. Told in free-verse poems, this is a raw, powerful, and emotional depiction of urban violence. 
                        The structure of the novel heightens the tension, as each stop of the elevator brings a new challenge until the narrative arrives at its taut, ambiguous ending.
                         There is considerable symbolism, including the 15 bullets in the gun and the way the elevator rules parallel street rules. Reynolds masterfully weaves in 
                        textured glimpses of the supporting characters. Throughout, readers get a vivid picture of Will and the people in his life, all trying to cope with the 
                        circumstances of their environment while expressing the love, uncertainty, and hope that all humans share. This astonishing book will generate much 
                        needed discussion. (Verse fiction. 12-adult)
