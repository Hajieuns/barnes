                    Then, one by one, the Osage began to be killed off. The family of an Osage woman, 
                    Mollie Burkhart, became a prime target. One of her relatives was shot. Another was 
                    poisoned. And it was just the beginning, as more and more Osage were dying under 
                    mysterious circumstances, and many of those who dared to investigate the killings 
                    were themselves murdered.

                    try to unravel the mystery. White put together an undercover team, including a 
                    Native American agent who infiltrated the region, and together with the Osage 
                    began to expose one of the most chilling conspiracies in American history.

                        and little besides except a stain, seldom vivid, on the consciousness of their white successors." The best thing about Grann's book is
                         that it stares, hard, at that stain, and makes it vivid indeed.

                        New Yorker staff writer Grann (The Lost City of Z) burnishes his reputation as a brilliant storyteller in this gripping true-crime 
                        narrative, which revisits a baffling and frightening—and relatively unknown—spree of murders occurring mostly in Oklahoma 
                        during the 1920s. From 1921 to 1926, at least two dozen people were murdered by a killer or killers apparently targeting members
                         of the Osage Indian Nation, who at the time were considered “the wealthiest people per capita in the world” thanks to the 
                        discovery of oil beneath their lands. The violent campaign of terror is believed to have begun with the 1921 disappearance of 
                        two Osage Indians, Charles Whitehorn and Anna Brown, and the discovery of their corpses soon afterwards, followed by many
                         other murders in the next five years. The outcry over the killings led to the involvement in 1925 of an “obscure” branch of the
                         Justice Department, J. Edgar Hoover’s Bureau of Investigation, which eventually charged some surprising figures with the murders.
                         Grann demonstrates how the Osage Murders inquiry helped Hoover to make the case for a “national, more professional, 
                        scientifically skilled” police force. Grann’s own dogged detective work reveals another layer to the case that Hoover’s men had
                         never exposed. Agents: Kathy Robbins and David Halpern, Robbins Office. (Apr.)

                        In the 1870s, the Osage Indians were herded onto a small tract of land in Oklahoma—land that unexpectedly held vast reserves of
                        oil, rendering the tribe incredibly rich overnight. By law, the Osage had mineral rights outright, although they were still treated like
                        children, requiring a white "guardian" to manage their assets. In 1921, there was a sudden upsurge in deaths of the Osage on the
                        reservation—accidents, bad whiskey, and outright murder. Author Grann (The Lost City of Z) writes of these crimes, where at 
                       least 18 Osage and three nontribe members met suspicious deaths by 1925, many of them members of the same family. The Osage
                        pleaded for the federal government to help, and J. Edgar Hoover, head of the fledgling FBI, sent agent Tom White to investigate.
                        White discovered that many of the victims were connected to a single man, an upstanding community leader who stood to profit 
                       handsomely from the murders. The long, drawn out investigation finally resulted in convictions and good publicity for the agency,
                        but some unanswered questions remain. VERDICT A spellbinding book about the largest serial murder investigation you've never
                        heard of, which will be enjoyed by fans of the Old West as well as true crime aficionados. [See Prepub Alert, 10/17/16.]

                        In 1920s Oklahoma, many members of the oil-wealthy Osage Nation were dying untimely and suspicious deaths. The widespread 
                        crimes against the Osage and the inability to identify those responsible led to the establishment of what is now known as the FBI. 
                        Grann, author of the best-selling The Lost City of Z, makes a complex web of violence and deception easy to follow by keeping the 
                        focus on one Osage woman, Mollie Burkhart, whose family members were murdered one by one. This gripping title uncovers a
                         baffling level of corruption. The author points his investigative lens at the perpetrators of the murders, reveals cover-ups by 
                        authorities all the way up to the national level, and illustrates that the deception continued almost a century later. There are plenty
                         of curriculum connections: Native American and Osage tribal history, economics, law enforcement, and journalism. A varied 
                        selection of photographs help to set the scene for readers. End pages include comprehensive source notes, citations, and a bibliography. 
                        VERDICT This thoroughly researched, suspenseful exposé will appeal to followers of true crime programs such as the podcast Serial
                         and the Netflix documentary series Making a Murderer, as well as to fans of Louise Erdrich's The Round House.—Tara Kehoe,

                        This audiobook will cause listeners to rethink everything they know about oil, the settlement of the West, and our nation’s treatment
                        of Native Americans. The work is so rich that it takes three people to perform it. While Ann Marie Lee has a lovely voice, it’s too light 
                       for the horror she recounts—the murder of dozens of Osage Indians in the 1920s for the purpose of obtaining rights to their oil-rich 
                       land in Oklahoma. Will Patton and Danny Campbell, who mainly narrate the investigation by the nascent FBI and the subsequent trial,
                        sound grim and gritty, as befits the story. It's amazing how much history and horror fills this book. Together, the narrators’ deliveries
                        are powerful, making it a story listeners will never forget. M.S. © AudioFile 2017, Portland, Maine

                        Greed, depravity, and serial murder in 1920s Oklahoma.During that time, enrolled members of the Osage Indian nation were among 
                        the wealthiest people per capita in the world. The rich oil fields beneath their reservation brought millions of dollars into the tribe
                         annually, distributed to tribal members holding "headrights" that could not be bought or sold but only inherited. This vast wealth 
                        attracted the attention of unscrupulous whites who found ways to divert it to themselves by marrying Osage women or by having
                         Osage declared legally incompetent so the whites could fleece them through the administration of their estates. For some, however,
                         these deceptive tactics were not enough, and a plague of violent death—by shooting, poison, orchestrated automobile accident, and
                         bombing—began to decimate the Osage in what they came to call the "Reign of Terror." Corrupt and incompetent law enforcement
                         and judicial systems ensured that the perpetrators were never found or punished until the young J. Edgar Hoover saw cracking these 
                        cases as a means of burnishing the reputation of the newly professionalized FBI. Bestselling New Yorker staff writer Grann (The Devil
                         and Sherlock Holmes: Tales of Murder, Madness, and Obsession, 2010, etc.) follows Special Agent Tom White and his assistants as 
                        they track the killers of one extended Osage family through a closed local culture of greed, bigotry, and lies in pursuit of protection 
                        for the survivors and justice for the dead. But he doesn't stop there; relying almost entirely on primary and unpublished sources, the
                         author goes on to expose a web of conspiracy and corruption that extended far wider than even the FBI ever suspected. This 
                        page-turner surges forward with the pacing of a true-crime thriller, elevated by Grann's crisp and evocative prose and enhanced by 
                        dozens of period photographs. Dogged original research and superb narrative skills come together in this gripping account of pitiless evil.
