                    Twenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail was supposed to enter the Scribe Quadrant, 
                    living a quiet life among books and history. Now, the commanding general—also

                <p>
                    But when you’re smaller than everyone else and your body is brittle, death is only a 
                    heartbeat away...because dragons don’t bond to “fragile” humans. They incinerate 
                    them.            
                </p>
                <p>
                    With fewer dragons willing to bond than cadets, most would kill Violet to better 
                    their own chances of success. The rest would kill her just for being her mother’s 
                    daughter—like Xaden Riorson, the most powerful and ruthless wingleader in the 
                    Riders Quadrant.

                <p>
                    Yet, with every day that passes, the war outside grows more deadly, the kingdom's 
                    protective wards are failing, and the death toll continues to rise. Even worse, Violet 
                    begins to suspect leadership is hiding a terrible secret.

                    Romance author Yarros (The Things We Leave Unfinished) blends the epic tale of a reluctant dragon rider’s coming-of-age with a sexy dark academia 
                    aesthetic in her astounding debut fantasy. Fearsome General Sorrengail demands that her children follow in her footsteps as dragon riders—even her 
                    youngest, Violet, who has trained her whole life to be a scribe like her late father. Forced to join a deadly war academy, Violet is unprepared to 
                    perform the fatal tasks all cadets must complete to become dragon riders. The odds are stacked against her due both to her delicate stature and to 
                    her mother’s reputation: it was Sorrengail who gave the order to execute all separatists in the last rebellion. The rebels’ orphaned children have all 
                    been conscripted to the academy, putting a target on Violet’s back. Worse, her own brooding but handsome wing leader, third-year student Xaden 
                    Riorson, is the son of the separatists’ leader. Meanwhile, the wards that protect the city are failing, but as danger draws nearer, clever Violet grows 
                    stronger, discovering that riding dragons may be her destiny after all. Yarros’s worldbuilding is intricate without being overbearing, setting the stage 
                    for Violet’s satisfying growth into a force to be reckoned with. Readers will be spellbound and eager for more. Agent: Louise Fury, Bent Agency. (May)

                        Violet Sorrengail wanted to be a scribe rather than join her siblings as dragon riders defending Navarre's borders, but her mother, a decorated general, 
                        had other ideas. She's forced Violet to enlist as a rider cadet in the Basgiath War College, even though Violet's hypermobility
                        —a disorder that destabilizes her joints and leaves her easily injured—puts her at a disadvantage. To make matters worse, Violet has been assigned 
                        to the Fourth Wing, led by Xaden Riorson, the son of a rebel leader whom her mother executed. Surrounded by dangers in a school designed to weed 
                        out the weak, Violet must use her wits and skill to overcome brutal challenges and vicious opponents. The bonds Violet forms with her fellow cadets 
                        offset the college's constant violence, and her slowly developing enemies-to-lovers relationship with Xaden will appeal to fans of the trope. 
                        Violet's hypermobility gives her a unique way of moving through the world, and Yarros (The Things We Leave Unfinished) uses characters' 
                        reactions to thoughtfully explore the ways in which others respond to the lived realities of people with disabilities. VERDICT A good selection 
                        for fans of Naomi Novik's "Scholomance" series; will fly off the shelves.—Erin Niederberger

                        Rebecca Yarros's exceptional fantasy novel comes to life through the performances of Rebecca Soler and Teddy Hamilton. Bookish Violet, who 
                        planned to become a scholar, has been ordered by the General (her mother) to become a dragon rider instead. Soler's narration captures the intensity 
                        of battle scenes and the complexities of relationships. Her ability to differentiate voices and breathe life into the dragons' distinct personalities adds 
                        depth and excitement. Teddy Hamilton's contribution in a special chapter brings additional variation. The combined talents of Soler and Hamilton 
                        make the audiobook a captivating choice. Fans of the novel and anyone seeking an engaging listening experience will be enthralled. The narrators' 
                        storytelling prowess ensures a thrilling blend of action, romance, and intrigue. F.S.M. © AudioFile 2023, Portland, Maine
