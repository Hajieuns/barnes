                    named Sirius Black. Convicted of killing thirteen people with a single curse, he 
                    was said to be the heir apparent to the Dark Lord, Voldemort.Now he has 
                    escaped, leaving only two clues as to where he might be headed: Harry Potter's 
                    defeat of You-Know-Who was Black's downfall as well. And the Azkaban guards 
                    heard Black muttering in his sleep, "He's at Hogwarts . . . he's at Hogwarts."
                    Harry Potter isn't safe, not even within the walls of his magical school, 
                    surrounded by his friends. Because on top of it all, there may well be a traitor in 
                    their midst.

                    J. K. Rowling continues to bewitch readers everywhere with the third book in her magical Potter series, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. 
                    Harry's ongoing exploits, along with those of his contemporaries, teachers, and relatives, are as imaginative, entertaining, and mysterious as ever. For 
                    during Harry's third year at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he must face his greatest challenge yet: a confrontation with Sirius Black, 
                    an escaped convict and madman who is rumored to be in cahoots with Harry's archenemy, the Dark Wizard Lord Voldemort. This alone would be 
                    daunting enough, but Harry's task is made even more trying when he discovers that Sirius is suspected of being the one who killed Harry's parents.

                    For Harry, the Hogwarts campus has always been a sanctuary, but when Black escapes from the horrifying clutches of Azkaban Prison, all clues suggest 
                    the madman is headed for Hogwarts and Harry himself. As a result, the school starts to feel more like a prison than a sanctuary as Harry finds himself 
                    constantly watched and under guard. What's more, the terrifying Dementors -- the horrifying creatures who guard Azkaban Prison -- are lurking about 
                    the campus looking for Black. And their effect on Harry is a devastating one.

                    Still, life at school offers plenty of distractions. Harry really likes the new teacher for Defense Against the Dark Arts, Professor Lupin, who might be able
                    to teach Harry how to defend himself against the Dementors. But Professor Snape's behavior toward Lupin has Harry wondering what secrets the two 
                   men are hiding. Harry's friend Hermione is also acting very strangely. And, of course, there is the tension caused by the ongoing Quidditch competition
                    between the Gryffindors and the Slytherins and the never-ending bullying of the Slytherin leader, Draco Malfoy.

                        Rowling proves that she has plenty of tricks left up her sleeve in this third Harry Potter adventure, set once again at the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft 
                        and Wizardry. Right before the start of term, a supremely dangerous criminal breaks out of a supposedly impregnable wizards' prison; it will come as no 
                        surprise to Potter fans that the villain, a henchman of Harry's old enemy Lord Voldemort, appears to have targeted Harry. In many ways this installment
                         seems to serve a transitional role in the seven-volume series: while many of the adventures are breathlessly relayed, they appear to be laying groundwork 
                        for even more exciting adventures to come. The beauty here lies in the genius of Rowling's plotting. Seemingly minor details established in books one and 
                        two unfold to take on unforeseen significance, and the finale, while not airtight in its internal logic, is utterly thrilling. Rowling's wit never flags, whether 
                        constructing the workings of the wizard world (Just how would a magician be made to stay behind bars?) or tossing off quick jokes (a grandmother wears 
                        a hat decorated with a stuffed vulture; the divination classroom looks like a tawdry tea shop). The Potter spell is holding strong. All ages. (Sept.) Copyright

                        Gr 4 Up-The third book in J.K. Rowling's wildly popular Harry Potter series (Scholastic, 1999) is spiritedly brought to life in this audiobook narrated by 
                        English actor/singer Jim Dale. In this installment, Harry's life seems to be in danger when Sirius Black, a wizard convicted of multiple murders, escapes 
                        from prison and appears to be heading towards Hogwarts to seek revenge against Harry for causing Voldemort's downfall. Dale, who also recorded the 
                        audio versions of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Jan. 2000, p. 73) and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (April 2000, p. 76) gives a tour 
                        de force reading performance as he chronicles Harry's third year at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. With his mastery of verbal inflection, 
                        expressive voice, and terrific accents, Dale deftly shifts from general narration to numerous character voices without disrupting the flow of the story. In fact,
                         his tone is so warm and inviting that listeners don't feel the tapes nearly 12 hours length; instead, they will eagerly anticipate listening to more. Adding 
                        Dale's vocal talents to Rowling's already well-written and engaging story makes this a quality audiobook worthy of inclusion in all audio collections.

                        Readers are welcoming back old friends, hissing at the recurring villians, cheering Harry's Quidditch team (Quidditch is a kind of aerial basketball 
                        played on broomsticks with five balls), and completely enthralled with the new mysteries that arise. And let me add here that Rowling is one of the few 
                        authors who, while playing fair, has still taken me by surprise with who the villian is in each book.

                        Midwest Book Review
                        PRAISE FOR HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE (September, 1998)"A wonderful first novel. Much like Roald Dahl, J.K. Rowling 
                        has a gift for keeping the emotions, fears, and triumphs of her characters on a human scale, even while the supernatural is popping out all over. The book 
                        is full of wonderful, sly humor [and] the characters are impressively three-dimensional (occasionally, four-dimensional!) and move along seamlessly through
                         the narrative. "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" is as funny, moving and impressive as the story behind its writing. Like Harry Potter, [J.K. Rowling]
                         has wizardry inside, and has soared beyond her modest Muggles surroundings to achieve something quite special."—The New York Times Book Review"
                        A charming, imaginative, magical confection of a novel...a glorious debut, a book of wonderful comic pleasures and dizzying imaginative flights. There is
                         no cause to doubt Rowling's abilities and promise, and every reason to expect great things, truly great things, from her in the future."—The Boston Sunday 
                        Globe"You don't have to be a wizard or a kid to appreciate the spell cast by Harry Potter."—USA Today"The story delights and the writing gives you 
                        goosebumps, the good kind."—Chicago Tribune"The huge cast of characters, set against a fantastic backdrop with good doses of action, humor and fun, 
                        will surely captivate..."—Seattle Times* "Readers are in for a delightful romp with this award-winning debut from a British author sho dances in the 
                        footsteps of P.L. Travers and Roald Dahl. There is enchantment, suspense, and danger galore (as well as enough creepy creatures to satisfy the most 
                        bogey-men-loving readers, and even a magical game of soccerlike Quidditch to entertain sports fans)."—Publishers Weekly, starred review* "After 
                        reading this entrancing fantasy, readers will be convinced that they, too, could take the train to Hogwarts School, if only they could find Platform Nine 
                        and Three Quarters at the King's Cross Station."—School Library Journal, starred review* "Rowling's first novel is a brilliantly imagined and beautifully
                         written fantasy that incorporates elements of traditional British school stories without once violating the magical underpinnings of the plot. In fact, 
                        Rowling's wonderful ability to put a fantastic spin on sports, student rivalry, and eccentric faculty contributes to the humor, charm, and well, delight of 
                        her utterly captivating story."—Booklist, starred review"A rousing first novel.... This hugely enjoyable fantasy is filled with imaginative details, from oddly 
                        flavored jelly beans to dragons' eggs hatched on the hearth.."—Kirkus Reviews

                        From the Publisher
                        Reading about Harry Potter at Hogwarts School must be a treat, or why would all J.K. Rowling’s books continue to top the NEW YORK TIMES bestseller 
                        lists? It’s pretty obvious that her storytelling is magical, but it’s also obvious that Jim Dale’s reading of it gives its “magic” an entirely new dimension. 
                        His captivating voice “summons” boggarts and werewolves, giant spiders and floating ghosts. This, the third book, is scarier than the others as Harry 
                        must face an escaped murderer who has tracked him down to Hogwarts. The narrator shows no mercy for his listeners as he hisses and snarls and cackles 
                        through one creepy scene after another. But he is also--and often--laugh-aloud funny. Rowling and Dale together are “word magicians”; without potions or
                         spells, they weave enchantment. J.C. Winner of AUDIOFILE Earphones Award. © AudioFile 2000, Portland, Maine
