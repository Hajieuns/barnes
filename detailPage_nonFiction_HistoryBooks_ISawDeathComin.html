                    The story of Reconstruction is often told from the perspective of the politicians, 
                    generals, and journalists whose accounts claim an outsized place in collective 
                    memory. But this pivotal era looked very different to African Americans in the 
                    South transitioning from bondage to freedom after 1865. They were besieged by a 
                    campaign of white supremacist violence that persisted through the 1880s and 
                    beyond. For too long, their lived experiences have been sidelined, impoverishing our 
                    understanding of the obstacles post-Civil War Black families faced, their inspiring 
                    determination to survive, and the physical and emotional scars they bore because 
                    of it.

                    In I Saw Death Coming, Kidada E. Williams offers a breakthrough account of the 
                    much-debated Reconstruction period, transporting readers into the daily existence 
                    of formerly enslaved people building hope-filled new lives. Drawing on overlooked 
                    sources and bold new readings of the archives, Williams offers a revelatory and, in 
                    some cases, minute-by-minute record of nighttime raids and Ku Klux Klan strikes. 
                    And she deploys cutting-edge scholarship on trauma to consider how the effects of 
                    these attacks would linger for decades—indeed, generations—to come.           
                </p>
                <p>
                    For readers of Carol Anderson, Tiya Miles, and Clint Smith, I Saw Death Coming is 
                    an indelible and essential book that speaks to some of the most pressing questions 
                    of our times.

                    The Ku Klux Klan was at the forefront of “a shadow army of paramilitary gangs” launched in the post–Civil War South in 
                    “the pursuit of the Confederate cause by other means,” according to this gripping debut from historian Williams. Basing her 
                    study on eyewitness testimonies given in congressional hearings during the early 1870s and recollections gathered by the 
                    Federal Writers Project in the 1930s, Williams documents how formerly enslaved people worked to reunite scattered families,
                     find homes and employment, and exercise their new political rights, while facing constant threats of violence from white 
                    Southerners who sought to prevent these advances. Among other horrors, Williams documents the whipping of Black 
                    children by “night riders,” campaigns of intimidation and torture waged against Black landowners by their white 
                    neighbors, and a father witnessing his son’s stabbing death in Limestone County, Ala. Along the way, Williams also 
                    pays tribute to Black families’ resilience and determination to fight back against harassment, details federal efforts to
                     stop the terror campaign and the forces that undermined them, and examines how the trauma of racialized violence
                     is passed down through generations. This harrowing report hits home. (Jan.)

                        U.S. constitutional amendments—the 13th abolishing slavery, the 14th guaranteeing legal protections, and the 15th awarding 
                        voting rights—were intended to bring about a new era of freedom for Black Americans. However, the Reconstruction Era in the 
                        South remained fraught with danger and legal subversion. Masked Ku Klux Klan members terrorized, attacked, maimed, and 
                        murdered Black people with little to no repercussions. The failure to properly enforce laws occurred at the local, state, and 
                        federal levels, which left the Black population still subjected to disenfranchisement and effectively barred from achieving basic 
                        human rights. Williams (history, Wayne State Univ.; They Left Great Marks on Me) excels at transforming exhaustive research 
                        and maps, notes, and an appendix, into an accessible narrative with appeal for a scholarly or general reader. Her ability to trace
                         select families through the decades truly reveals the lasting negative effect of Reconstruction-era terror on those who had hope 
                        snatched away. She reveals the seeds of social racism from the past, which sadly remain firmly planted. VERDICT A recommended 
                        heart-wrenching read that provides significant insight into the historical basis of racial conflict in the United States.

                        A broad-ranging study of anti-Black violence in the Reconstruction era.     
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        Reconstruction was not so much a failure as an effort that was sabotaged from the outset. The administration of Andrew Johnson was 
                        committed to White supremacy, and the Confederates, though militarily defeated, never really surrendered. Immediately after the Civil 
                        War, the Ku Klux Klan was founded, and “night riders” began visiting violence on Black Americans who dared press for civil and 
                        economic rights. As historian Williams shows, these visits were carefully coordinated, indicating some sort of central organization as 
                        opposed to the commonly held belief that they were impromptu and rare attacks. The attacks “frequently targeted prosperous Black 
                        people,” seizing income-producing tools and even whole crops. In some instances, as Williams chronicles, Black people organized 
                        resistance, and the night riders tended accordingly to steer clear of situations where they were likely to face gunfire. “Yet even within 
                        a limited space to operate, right-wingers committed extensive atrocities,” she adds. Because they demanded total domination over 
                        Southern society, another understandable Black response was to move, as happened in the Deep South in 1879, “a hurried, mass 
                        movement of significant numbers in months” on the part of people called Exodusters, with Kansas gaining 30,000 Black migrants 
                        almost overnight. A combination of anti-Black violence, economic disenfranchisement, and voter suppression—all of which lend 
                        this book an altogether timely feel—doomed efforts to make Black Southerners equal citizens. Too many historians, Williams 
                        observes, have brushed such matters aside, blaming the failure of Reconstruction on its Northern champions, but Black Southerners 
                        did not forget, and many of the testimonials and eyewitness accounts that she draws on come from field recordings from the 
                        1930s—even though, as she concludes, “Black counter-histories of atrocity and betrayal were no match for the machinery of the 
                        Lost Cause.” Pair this book with Margaret A. Burnham’s By Hands Now Known.

                        survivors and witnesses of racist attacks gave in their own words. The result is a shattering narrative of Reconstruction that attends both
                         to what formerly enslaved people managed to build after emancipation and to all that was taken away from them in the maelstrom of 
                        violence that followed.” —W. Caleb McDaniel, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Sweet Taste of Liberty

                        “Writing with both great insight and passion, Kidada E. Williams shows how Black southerners navigated the hardships of their lives in 
                        freedom in I Saw Death Coming. Their hope and determination provoked the ire of white supremacists who attacked Black homes and 
                        families, launching a second civil war to overthrow Reconstruction. The stories of these men and women who endured tremendous 
                        violence, persevered, and gave voice to their experiences will remain with you long after you finish this powerful and heart-wrenching
                         book.” —Megan Kate Nelson, author of The Three-Cornered War and Saving Yellowstone

                        communities in the wake of the Civil War, just as she exposes the brutal campaign of terror waged by white southerners who sought 
                        to reimpose a lost antebellum world. Williams artfully allows her readers to see these struggles through the eyes of those who built 
                        schools and churches and forged political campaigns in hopes of transforming their region. A profound work of the utmost 
                        importance for anyone who wishes to understand the Reconstruction era.”

                        derailed their plans for freedom, shattered their families, and left them emotionally traumatized. This book is a powerful act of moral 
                        witnessing that invites us to think anew about whose voices and experiences are valued, both in the past and in the present. What we 
                        do next is up to us.” —Kate Masur, author of Until Justice Be Done
