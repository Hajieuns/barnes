                    Adelaide Henry carries an enormous steamer trunk with her wherever she goes. 
                    It’s locked at all times. Because when the trunk is opened, people around her 
                    start to disappear...            
                </p>
                <p>
                    The year is 1914, and Adelaide is in trouble. Her secret sin killed her parents, and 
                    forced her to flee her hometown of Redondo, California, in a hellfire rush, ready to 
                    make her way to Montana as a homesteader. Dragging the trunk with her at every 
                    stop, she will be one of the "lone women" taking advantage of the government's 
                    offer of free land for those who can cultivate it—except that Adelaide isn't alone.
                    And the secret she's tried so desperately to lock away might be the only thing 
                    keeping her alive.        
                </p>
                <p>
                    Told in Victor LaValle's signature style, blending historical fiction, shimmering 
                    prose, and inventive horror, Lone Women is the gripping story of a woman 
                    desperate to bury her past—and a portrait of early twentieth-century America 
                    like you've never seen.

                    World Fantasy Award winner LaValle (The Changeling) returns with a haunting historical horror novel. In 1915, Adelaide Henry 
                    flees her California hometown following the death of her parents, for which she feels responsible. Inspired by a testimonial 
                    from a single woman who took advantage of a loophole in a homesteading opportunity offered by the federal government, 
                    Adelaide makes the trek to Montana with a mysterious steamer trunk in tow. The trunk contains her deepest, darkest 
                    secrets, and as her journey unfolds, readers will get a sense of creeping wrongness about the object, which, Adelaide is adamant, 
                    must remain locked at all times. When she arrives in Montanna, Adelaide is unprepared for the harsh winter and the unfamiliar ways of 
                    her neighbors: “A woman on her own, a Black woman out here in Montana, far from the Black community she’d known in Lucerne
                     Valley, must remain vigilant for her own sense of safety. In truth, she’d never been around so many white people.” 
                    As she adjusts to her new life, she finds that escaping her past is not as easy as she hoped, and that her secrets, 
                    once out, could spell death for everyone around her. A counter to the typical homesteading narrative, this moody and masterful 
                    western fires on all cylinders. Readers are sure to be impressed. Agent: Gloria Loomis, Watkins/Loomis Agency. (Mar.)

                        “In his new book, Lone Women, author Victor LaValle transports readers to the desolate plains of 1915 Montana . . .
                        though it’s set more than a century ago, this eerie story of a haunted would-be homesteader cobbling 
                       together a life she doesn’t want to escape from feels both prescient and modern.”—ESSENCE

                        “Victor LaValle is one of the best . . . and Lone Women is an absolute page turner. It’s a tale of hardship and strength and community, 
                        but also of the creeping quiet of the American Midwest, of loneliness, and the hauntings we cannot rid ourselves of.”—Tordotcom

                        Shirley Jackson Award winner LaValle (The Changeling) beautifully captures the vastness of the 1915 Montana frontier and the
                        subtlety of terror in his latest. Adelaide Henry has a dark secret: a terrible curse gifted to her family the day she was born. 
                       Destined to live in shame or die from it, Adelaide flees her family farm in California to be a homesteader. 
                       Desperate to start over, she buys property in Montana, sight unseen, and brings with her only a steamer trunk 
                       that holds the secret she can't keep for long, 
                       though as a tall Black woman, she finds it difficult to blend in. The history of Adelaide is as murky as her future is 
                       unpredictable, but the only way to move forward is to face her demons and tell her truth. A chilling tale of isolation, 
                       shame, regret, and survival, LaValle's novel is incredibly immersive—readers will hear the wind of the prairie, smell the wood smoke, 
                       see the bloodstains, and feel the fear. VERDICT LaValle grips readers with the subtle terror of inevitability, 
                       only to hold tight with tenderness.—Alana Quarles

                        A woman heads to Big Sky Country with some unusual baggage—actual, metaphorical, and psychological.
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        As LaValle’s beguiling, genre-blending fifth novel opens, it’s 1915, and something so awful has happened to Adelaide 
                        Henry’s parents that she’s set the family’s California farmhouse ablaze with their corpses inside. 
                        With little but rumor to go on, she high-tails it to Montana, believing the state will be welcoming toward
                         a young Black woman with farming skills and an urge to erase an ugly past. Early on, she seems proven right—the residents of Big Sandy are
                         friendly, supportive, and not too inquisitive about what’s inside her unusually heavy steamer trunk. But in time the region’s secretive nature comes 
                        into view, starting with a woman with four blind children who prove to be at the center of a host of deceits. And once the contents of that 
                        steamer trunk are unleashed, Adelaide is further pushed into self-preservation mode than she already was as the sole Black woman in
                         a very White and very cold place. LaValle is prodigiously talented at playing with stylistic modes, and here he deftly combines Western, suspense, 
                        supernatural, and horror—his prose is unfussy and plainspoken, which makes it easier to seamlessly skate across genres. But 
                        LaValle’s fluidity when it comes to style is balanced by a focused thematic vision: Through Adelaide (and that steamer trunk), he explores isolation 
                        and division across race, within families, and through communities. Her struggle to find her place is complicated by everyone being tight-lipped and 
                        eager to create pariahs. (“The silence is the worst part of this suffering,” as Adelaide puts it.) The closing chapters get somewhat knotted as LaValle labors to 
                        corral a Pandora’s box full of plot points. But the novel overall is a winning blend of brains and (occasionally violent) thrills.
