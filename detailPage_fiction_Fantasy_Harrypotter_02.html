                <p class="nonunder">
                    The summer after his first year at Hogwarts is worse than ever for Harry Potter. 
                    The Dursleys of Privet Drive are more horrible to him than ever before. And just 
                    when he thinks the endless summer vacation is over, a creature named Dobby the 
                    house-elf shows up issuing a grave warning to Harry not to go back to school or 
                    disaster will happen! Of course, Harry has to go back- and he does so in grand 
                    style, in a flying-car magicked by his friends Ron and Percy Weasley. But getting 
                    back to Hogwarts isn't the cure Harry expects it to be. Almost immediately a 
                    student is found turned to stone, and then another. And somehow Harry stands 
                    accused. Could Harry Potter be the long-feared heir of Slytherin? Harry and 
                    friends Hermione and Fred are stretched to their limits in a desperate fight 
                    against Draco Malfoy and his gang, the hideously stuck-up new professor 
                    Gilderoy Lockheart, the malevolent owner of the diary of Tom Riddle, giant 
                    spiders, and perhaps even...Hagrid!This is the book that proves J.K. Rowling is 
                    a talent that's here to stay!

                    another ten years to complete, concluding in 2007 with the publication of Harry

                    J. K. Rowling continues her phenomenally popular Harry Potter series with yet another tale of magic, mirth, and mayhem. Like its predecessor, Harry 
                    Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (the first book in the series), Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is chock-full of fascinating characters, frightful 
                    events, and fun wizardry.
                </span>
                <span>
                    Harry's on summer break after completing his first year at the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry, and his aunt, uncle, and cousin are as 
                    mean as ever, trying at every turn to keep him from fulfilling his destiny as a wizard. Their efforts to prevent his return to Hogwarts are aided by an 
                    unknown force: a mysterious elf who shows up and warns Harry that he must never return to the school. Before departing, the elf performs a bit of 
                    mischievous magic that is blamed on Harry. As a result, Harry not only gets a stern warning from Hogwarts for using magic in the "real" world; he is 
                    also locked away by his aunt and uncle in a tiny closet beneath the stairs.     
                </span>

                    Harry is eventually rescued by his classmates and friends, the redheaded Weasleys, but getting back to Hogwarts still proves to be a challenge. When 
                    he finally does get there, his troubles quickly multiply. Someone has opened the door to the Chamber of Secrets, releasing a deadly monster with the 
                    power to kill. Several classmates turn up petrified, and in addition to trying to puzzle out who the culprit is, Harry finds himself a prime suspect. 
                    The truth lies down the end of a trail marked by a magical diary with invisible ink, a ghost who hides inside a toilet, a flying car, a pompous new 
                    teacher with a talent for hyperbole, and some ghastly giant spiders. When one of Harry's friends is imprisoned and another is turned to stone, Harry 
                    is forced to once again confront his archenemy, the Dark Wizard Voldemort, who has a whole new bag of nasty tricks up his sleeve.

                    Rowling packs this tale with plenty of adventure and action, keeping the pace fast and furious. There's plenty of humor, too -- both subtle and bold 
                    -- as well as a few moral lessons. With overlapping themes that range from the simple (treating others with courtesy) to the sophisticated (racism), 
                    Rowling's Potter tales should appeal to readers of all ages -- the young as well as the young at heart.

                        Gr 3-8-Fans of the phenomenally popular Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Scholastic, 1998) won't be disappointed when they rejoin Harry, now 
                        on break after finishing his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Reluctantly spending the summer with the Dursleys, his mean 
                        relatives who fear and detest magic, Harry is soon whisked away by his friends Ron, Fred, and George Weasley, who appear at his window in a flying 
                        Ford Anglia to take him away to enjoy the rest of the holidays with their very wizardly family. Things don't go as well, though, when the school term 
                        begins. Someone, or something, is (literally) petrifying Hogwarts' residents one by one and leaving threatening messages referring to a Chamber of 
                        Secrets and an heir of Slytherin. Somehow, Harry is often around when the attacks happen and he is soon suspected of being the perpetrator. The 
                        climax has Harry looking very much like Indiana Jones, battling a giant serpent in the depths of the awesome and terrible Chamber of Secrets. Along 
                        with most of the teachers and students introduced in the previous book, Draco Malfoy has returned for his second year and is more despicable than ever. 
                        The novel is marked throughout by the same sly and sophisticated humor found in the first book, along with inventive, new, matter-of-fact uses of magic 
                        that will once again have readers longing to emulate Harry and his wizard friends.-Susan L. Rogers, Chestnut Hill Academy, PA Copyright 1999 Cahners

                        In this sequel to the phenomenally popular Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (rev. 1/99), Harry returns to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and 
                        Wizardry for his second year after a miserable summer with his Muggle (nonmagical) relatives. Once again, Harry's school experiences are colored 
                        by encounters with genial ghosts and antagonistic teachers, by the rivalry between good-guy Gryffindor House and slimy Slytherin House, and by an 
                        ominous mystery to be solved involving Harry's archenemy, the dark sorcerer Lord Voldemort. Once again, the attraction of Rowling's traditional 
                        British school story is magnified tenfold by the fantasy elements superimposed upon it. The atmosphere Rowling creates is unique; the story whizzes 
                        along; Harry is an unassuming and completely sympathetic hero. But, truth to tell, you may feel as if you've read it all before. Rowling clearly hit on
                         a winning formula with the first Harry Potter book; the second book-though still great fun-feels a tad, well, formulaic.

                        This sequel to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (1998) brings back the doughty young wizard-in-training to face suspicious adults, hostile 
                        classmates, fretful ghosts, rambunctious spells, giant spiders, and even an avatar of Lord Voldemort, the evil sorcerer who killed his parents, 
                        while saving the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from a deadly, mysterious menace. Ignoring a most peculiar warning, Harry kicks 
                        off his second year at Hogwarts after a dreadful summer with his hateful guardians, the Dursleys, and is instantly cast into a whirlwind of magical 
                        pranks and misadventures, culminating in a visit to the hidden cavern where his friend Ron's little sister Ginny lies, barely alive, in a trap set by his 
                        worst enemy. Surrounded by a grand mix of wise and inept faculty, sneering or loyal peers—plus an array of supernatural creatures including Nearly
                         Headless Nick and a huge, serpentine basilisk—Harry steadily rises to every challenge, and though he plays but one match of the gloriously chaotic 
                        field game Quidditch, he does get in plenty of magic and a bit of swordplay on his way to becoming a hero again. Readers will be irresistibly drawn 
                        into Harry's world by GrandPre's comic illustrations and Rowling's expert combination of broad boarding school farce and high fantasy. (Fiction. 11-14)

                        There are even more verbs than magic (and there’s a lot of magic to be had) in the Harry Potter series. Or, perhaps the magic is in the verbs. Jim 
                        Dale delivers Harry’s second adventure with verve, maintaining total command of the frenetic plot and the multitudinous characters. Harry returns 
                        to Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry in spite of warnings to stay away from elf Dobby (Dale’s most distinctive character, who, like Bob 
                        Dole, speaks only in the third person). What does it all have to do with his origins as a wizard? As heroic Harry, cranky Ron, and brainy Hermione 
                        set off to find out, Dale creates a completely believable parallel world of spells, incantations and transfigurations formerly unknown to us
