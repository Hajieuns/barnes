                        He dreams of owning his own grove, but the rigid class system of Sicily thwarts 
                        his ambition. Determined to secure a better future, Franco will do anything to

                    Gaetano Catalano is an idealistic young lawyer whose devotion to justice is 
                    tantamount to a calling. He’s a member of the Beati Paoli, a real-life secret society 
                    of aristocrats who investigate crime in Palermo, a city riddled with graft. Gaetano 
                    sets out to find the boy and punish the kidnapper, but his mission leads him to a 
                    darker place than he had ever imagined.

                    Meanwhile, Mafalda Pancari is a new mother rejoicing at the birth of her daughter, 
                    Lucia, when disaster strikes. And Alfredo D’Antonio is a reclusive goatherd under 
                    constant threat of being discovered as a Jew. How the lives of these unforgettable 
                    characters collide makes Loyalty an epic tale of good versus evil, as the story twists 
                    and turns to its monumental showdown.

                    Readers will be transported to the dramatic and ruggedly beautiful island of Sicily, 
                    the jewel of the Mediterranean, where lush lemon groves and mouth-watering 
                    cuisine contrast with a turbulent history of colonization and corruption. Scottoline 
                    brings her decades of thriller writing to historical fiction, creating in Loyalty a 
                    singular novel that no reader will be able to put down.

                    Scottoline (Eternal) delves into the origins of the Sicilian Mafia with the intriguing story of a kidnapping. In early 19th-century 
                    Palermo, five-year-old Dante Michangeli is abducted from his wealthy family and left in a madhouse. Meanwhile, Roberto 
                    Fiorvanti and his twin brother, Franco, who manages a baron’s lemon grove, scheme to make money by organizing a protection 
                    racket that targets people traveling to deliver their produce to market. Fifteen years later, Palermo lawyer Gaetano Catalano, 
                    newly released from prison for breaking and entering during his search for information about Dante, finds the now 20-year-old at 
                    the madhouse and offers to help him reunite with his family. But Dante is reluctant to leave, as he’s fallen in love with Lucia Pancari, 
                    a beautiful woman who lives off the land and was taught by her mother to keep away from men, but has been visiting Dante at the 
                    madhouse after seeking refuge there from lemon pickers. The worlds of these seemingly disparate characters collide with a series of 
                    revelations about the complex situation behind Dante’s kidnapping. Scottoline brings her characters to life, instilling them with wit 
                    and intellect as they navigate the corruption of Sicily’s law enforcement. Historical crime fiction fans will be riveted. Agent: Robert

                        "I haven’t read a story set in Sicily that was this good since Giuseppe Di Lampedusa’s amazing novel The Leopard. The reader knows 
                        when an author’s heart is in their writing, and Lisa Scottoline’s heart and soul is in Loyalty. Historical fiction, when it’s good, is a time 
                        machine, carrying us back to a vanished world that we can inhabit for a while. Loyalty does that and more—it’s a magic carpet ride that 
                        will transform us and stay with us. A beautifully written tale, wonderfully told by a master storyteller."

                        "A gripping, up-all-night novel of power and vengeance in a violent and beautiful land. Loyalty finds Lisa Scottoline on new turf—and 
                        firing on all cylinders. Her versatility as a writer knows no bounds."

                        "Nineteenth-century Sicily springs to vivid, unforgettable life in Loyalty, a passionate epic of the Mafia‘s origins among the fragrant lemon 
                        groves of Palermo. A kidnapped child confined to a madhouse, a castoff wife raising her daughter in the wild, an upright lawyer on a crusade 
                        for justice, and twin brothers determined to rise to power—their lives entwine across Lisa Scottoline’s gorgeous tapestry of Sicilian history. 
                        An absolute feast for readers everywhere!"

                        "Loyalty is a wonderfully atmospheric and operatic tale about the origins of the Mafia in the wake of Sicily's crumbling feudal system…
                        At heart, though, this is an earthy novel, the vivid details of which make you smell the sweet lemon groves, feel the salty sea spray on your 
                        cheeks, and taste the pasta, pistachios and rich cheeses of Sicily. Brava!"

                    <span>
                        "This brilliantly told story about the rise of the Mafia is an unforgettable saga of the powers of corruption and courage, injustice and honor, 
                        family secrets, loyalty and love set against the evocative backdrop of Sicily. Scottoline deftly explores the darkest passions and the deepest 
                        compassion of human nature in a fabulously twisty historical thriller that will keep you guessing until the very end."

                        Five-year-old Dante is lured away from his mother during Palermo’s Festival of St. Rosalia in 1810 and imprisoned in the Ospizio di Santa 
                        Teresa. The asylum is so hellish that Dante has no idea he’s been shown mercy: Franco Fiorvanti, the ambitious lemon-grove manager who 
                        arranged his kidnapping, had been ordered to have him killed. While local attorney Gaetano Catalano calls on his friends in the real-life 
                        Beati Paoli to organize a search for the boy as he languishes in the madhouse, Franco, who dreams of starting his own orchard by purchasing 
                        some of the land he works from wealthy Baron Zito, tirelessly schemes with and sometimes against his twin brother, Roberto, to amass the 
                        necessary resources to achieve his goals. The community he assembles dabbles in many crimes but gradually morphs into a well-oiled 
                        protection racket. Over the next 15 years, cheese maker Alfredo D’Antonio struggles to hide his identity as the last Jew in Sicily, and Mafalda 
                        Pancari, whose newborn daughter, Lucia, is stigmatized as an albino, abandons her husband and her fair-weather friends to raise the girl on 
                        her own. The pattern behind all these subplots is clear enough: examining the perils of both social isolation and social overinvesting of those 
                        who place their community above themselves and God. But the tale is so sprawling and filled with so many pop-up outrages and violent 
                        deaths that the mastermind behind the kidnapping doesn’t even make it onto the Cast of Characters.

                        Whatever you think, Scottoline’s been so successful that she’s certainly entitled to write more sagas like this one.

                        After Lisa Scottoline's introduction, Edoardo Ballerini transports listeners to Sicily with his perfect Italian and his intelligent grasp of the people 
                        who inhabit this historical novel. Five-year-old Dante is kidnapped and hidden in a madhouse. A young lawyer, a member of an elite group of 
                        aristocrats who investigate crime in Palermo, determines to find the boy. While he's searching, listeners meet the cheese-maker who's secretly 
                        the last Jew in Sicily and a woman whose daughter is born an albino. From the decent attorney to the greedy baron to the murderous lemon 
                        grove owners, Ballerini makes them all authentic. He makes Sicily itself a character, portraying its people in a style as rugged and uncompromising 
                        as its landscape. Violence, a vendetta, and passion fill the stories in this saga. S.J.H. © AudioFile 2023, Portland, Maine
