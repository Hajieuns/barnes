                <p>
                    From Inciting Joy, to The Book of Delights, to now The Book of (More) Delights, 
                    Ross Gay helps us understand each other, the world and our place in it. The mini-
                    essays contained within The Book of (More) Delights give pause to consider the day 
                    ahead. It’s a heartfelt reminder to live your life the way you want to live it.                   
                </p>
                <p class="bold italic">
                    The New York Times bestselling author of The Book of Delights and Inciting Joy is 
                    back with exactly the book we need in these unsettling times.
                    “Yes, please. I'll have another dose of delight.” 
                    —Margaret Roach, New York Times 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Ross Gay’s new collection of small, daily wonders, again written over the course 
                    of a year, one of America’s most original voices continues his ongoing investigation 
                    of delight.                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    For Gay, what delights us is what connects us, what gives us meaning, from the joy 
                    of hearing a nostalgic song blasting from a passing car to the pleasure of refusing 
                    the “nefarious” scannable QR code menus, from the tiny dog he fell hard for to his 
                    mother baking a dozen kinds of cookies for her grandchildren. As always, Gay 
                    revels in the natural world—sweet potatoes being harvested, a hummingbird 
                    carousing in the beebalm, a sunflower growing out of a wall around the cemetery, 
                    the shared bounty from a neighbor’s fig tree—and the trillion mysterious ways this 
                    glorious earth delights us.                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Book of (More) Delights is a volume to savor and share.

                <p>
                    Poet Gay once again engages in a daily “delight practice” in the enchanting encore to The Book of Delights. In 81 brief essays, Gay turns 
                    his perpetually wonder-struck eye on the people and places around him, constructing an elaborate ode to the art of close attention. 
                    For example, in “The Lady in the Tree,” he spins a trip to the laundromat into a hallucinatory romp; in “Dream Dancing,” he falls 
                    into a synergistic dance with young people in a park; and in “One Million Kisses,” he overcomes his reservations about small dogs by 
                    caring for his mother-in-law’s “pipsqueak pup.” Through it all, Gay’s lyrical, stream-of-consciousness style—which always remains on 
                    the right side of saccharine (“Before you go there,” he addresses the reader, “I’m not being optimistic. I’m just paying attention”)
                    —lends potentially mundane subject matter, such as stopping for lunch on a road trip or observing neighborhood garden gnomes, a 
                    shimmering, near-magical quality. These unforgettable vignettes will enhance readers’ appreciation for their own surroundings. Agent:

                        <span>In this follow-up toThe Book of Delights, the esteemed poet catalogs more quiet pleasures and causes for gratitude.</span>
                        <p>
                            Gay adheres to the same guidelines he followed in the previous volume: “write them daily, write them quickly, and write them by hand.”
                            The first piece, of 81, opens, “Well, here we are again: this time, my forty-seventh birthday,” and describes a “bounty of delights” that he and 
                           his partner, Stephanie, have found in a rented Vermont cabin—e.g., the “forageable bounty” of apples. The following entry pays tribute to his 
                           friend Walt on his birthday: “I have needed to be—we need to be—believed in. Which, in a certain kind of way, is like being birthed. And just 
                           like his gummy bears and hockey sticks, I guess I’m taking Walt’s birthday. Because when Walt was born, so too was I.” The author offers 
                           steadfast company in his optimistic, accessible vignettes and insights about easily overlooked quotidian life. The essays are short, roughly 
                           three pages, and it’s a credit to Gay’s tone that he can captivate readers while writing about, for instance, “three truly beautiful spoons,” 
                           the pleasure of petting his cat, his annual garlic planting (“garlic’s your tiny professor of faith, your pungent don of gratitude”) and, in a 
                           separate piece, garlic harvesting. His sense of wonder at watching an NPR Tiny Desk Concert featuring El DeBarge leads him to this 
                           reflection on an Aretha Franklin cover: “She lets it be known, this is for the benefit of you who don’t believe.” Gay closes with an essay 
                           sharing the same name as the first, “My Birthday, Again,” in which the author writes, “I’ve completed another year of delights. Or maybe 
                           I should say another year of delights has completed me.”
                        </p>
                        <span>Keenly observed and delivered with deftness, these essays are a testament to the artfulness of attention and everyday joy.

                            oss Gay's second book of "essayettes" celebrating delight is as joyful, buoyant, utterly life-affirming, and wonderfully meandering as his first 
                            one. Over a year, he writes about the delight he finds in cats, trading fruit, trees, remembering his father, a woman talking to passersby on her 
                            porch and the many other residents of Bloomington, Indiana, poetry, teachers, kissing small dogs, and a whole lot more. His narration is warm 
                            and conversational and absolutely overflowing with gratitude. These praise songs come alive in his easy poet's voice, often tinged with a smile or 
                            a laugh, full of curiosity, agile, and inviting. Gay's earnest love of the world is not merely welcome--it is vital. This short audiobook is a triumph.
