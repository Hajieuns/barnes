                <p>
                    Get ready for a once-in-a-generation memoir from the beating heart of rock and roll. 
                    From the triumphs of the Beatles and the Stones to the brilliance of the Boss, he was 
                    there. Jann Wenner captured an entire generation of superstars, from Mick and 
                    Keith to John and Paul, from Bono and Elton to Bruce. Here, Wenner reflects on his 
                    life and some of the most intimate, moving, and unforgettable stories from the 
                    history of rock.              
                </p>
                <p class="bold">
                    In this New York Times bestseller, Rolling Stone founder, co-editor, and publisher 
                    Jann Wenner offers a "touchingly honest" and "wonderfully deep" memoir from the 
                    beating heart of classic rock and roll (Bruce Springsteen).           
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jann Wenner has been called by his peers “the greatest editor of his generation.”

                    His deeply personal memoir vividly describes and brings you inside the music, the 
                    politics, and the lifestyle of a generation, an epoch of cultural change that swept 
                    America and beyond. The age of rock and roll in an era of consequence, what will 
                    be considered one of the great watersheds in modern history. Wenner writes with the 
                    clarity of a journalist and an essayist. He takes us into the life and work of Bob 
                    Dylan, John Lennon, Mick Jagger, Bono, and Bruce Springsteen, to name a few. He 
                    was instrumental in the careers of Hunter S. Thompson, Tom Wolfe, and Annie 
                    Leibovitz. His journey took him to the Oval Office with his legendary interviews 
                    with Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, leaders to whom Rolling Stone gave its 
                    historic, full-throated backing. From Jerry Garcia to the Dalai Lama, Aretha 
                    Franklin to Greta Thunberg, the people Wenner chose to be seen and heard in the 
                    pages of Rolling Stone tried to change American culture, values, and morality.

                        Wenner turned on to drugs and politics as a student at Berkeley in 1964 but by 1967, it seemed to him "the only thing people were making 
                        better than drugs was music." That year, Wenner and music critic Ralph J. Gleason founded Rolling Stone. It quickly became one of the 
                        most influential magazines in America, read not only for music reviews but also for the quality of its writing and its take on public issues. 
                        In 1995, Wenner dissolved a 28-year marriage and moved in with Matt, now his husband. (His wife had known he was gay from the start.)
                         He has hung out with virtually every big name in the rock world, including Dylan, Lennon, Ono, Jagger, Springsteen, and Bono. He also
                         boasts of his friendships with Hunter S. Thompson, Tom Wolfe, Annie Leibovitz, Richard Avedon, and presidents Clinton and Obama. 
                        There are so many in rapid succession that often they blur as individuals. Three relationships stand out. With Jagger and Thompson—
                        difficult to unpack characters—they were complicated, with Springsteen, more direct. Wenner's description of Tom Cruise? All front and 
                        deflection. VERDICT Wenner writes engagingly and doesn't pull his punches. It'll be hard to keep this book on the library shelves.

                        weaving through the cultural upheaval that began in the 1960s and upended everything we took for granted about music, being young, and the
                         prevailing moral order. In the midst of that turmoil, Jann Wenner started and edited ROLLING STONE, the magazine that captured better

                        The Rolling Stone founder and publisher recounts a golden age of sex, drugs, rock ’n’ roll, and cash flow. 
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        As Wenner (b. 1947) admits, he grew up in privilege: His first car was a Jaguar, and he got his first editing gig with the yearbook of his 
                        private school. He was swayed from preppiedom with the advent of rock, which he correctly deems a form of “soft power.” Though he 
                        missed the Beatles’ legendary performance on The Ed Sullivan Show, he became a devotee after seeing A Hard Day’s Night. This long 
                        narrative is bracketed by his 2017 sale of the magazine he founded in 1967, its title borrowed from the Dylan song and not the British 
                        band. Soon enough, though, Wenner became friendly with both the Beatles and the Stones. The magazine was revolutionary, especially
                         early on. As the author notes, it “introduced black music to an expanding white audience—not as music for white people created by 
                        black people, but as black music in and of itself.” Staffed by the likes of Ben Fong-Torres, Joe Eszterhas, Hunter S. Thompson, and 
                        Annie Leibovitz, it also soon became an outlet of choice for musical acts around the world. In fact, John Lennon’s first extensive 
                        interview ran in is pages. (Wenner does allow that there were bands that hated the magazine, notably Led Zeppelin.) In time, 
                        Wenner decided to abandon the “fading hippie orthodoxy” of San Francisco for the bright lights of New York, where—with the
                         madcap Thompson in tow—Rolling Stone became a journal of politics as much as music, cheering on Jimmy Carter and Bill 
                        Clinton. The author writes frankly about money, sex (including his own long years in the closet), and his regret at selling his 
                        creation: “The new mantra was clear: What counted was not the printed word but the number of ‘hits’ on the website.”
