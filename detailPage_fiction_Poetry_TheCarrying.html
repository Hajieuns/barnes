                    From U.S. Poet Laureate Ada Limón comes The Carrying—her most powerful 
                    collection yet.           
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vulnerable, tender, acute, these are serious poems, brave poems, exploring with 
                    honesty the ambiguous moment between the rapture of youth and the grace of 
                    acceptance. A daughter tends to aging parents. A woman struggles with infertility—
                    “What if, instead of carrying / a child, I am supposed to carry grief?”—and a body 
                    seized by pain and vertigo as well as ecstasy. A nation convulses: “Every song of 
                    this country / has an unsung third stanza, something brutal.” And still Limón shows 
                    us, as ever, the persistence of hunger, love, and joy, the dizzying fullness of our too-
                    short lives. “Fine then, / I’ll take it,” she writes. “I’ll take it all.”

                    In Bright Dead Things, Limón showed us a heart “giant with power, heavy with

                <span>Praise for The Carrying</span>
                <span>Winner of the 2018 National Book Critics Circle Award</span>

                    “Limón has a novelistic knack for scene, and the narrative lyrics in this remarkable collection, her fifth, could stand as compressed 
                    stories about anxiety and the body.”—New York Times                    
                </span>
                <span>
                    “Exquisite . . . Limón is always a careful witness, accurately recording the moment, rather than trying to transcend it. Evocative 
                    dreams and pivotal memories help make this collection a powerful example of how to carry the things that define us without 
                    being broken by them.”—Washington Post                    
                </span>
                <span>
                    “[In The Carrying] the National Book Award-nominated poet pens paeans to the world’s limitless capacity to astonish.”
                    —O, The Oprah Magazine                    
                </span>
                <span>
                    “Limón is a poet of ecstatic revelation. Her poetry feels fast, full of details, often playful, and driven by conversational voice. This 
                    book represents a powerful deepening of the poet’s perspective. . . . It’s a book of deep wisdom and urgent vulnerability, driven by 
                    language that feels not only beautiful but permanent and powerfully wrought, like a mountain. It leads you to the beautiful bright 
                    mountaintop of language, then guides you gently down into the rocky valleys of a conscious human heart.”—Tracy K. Smith, Guardian                    
                </span>
                <span>
                    “Masterful . . . A piercing look into the nature of pain and impermanence . . . It is a paean to nature itself, to the peace in knowing it’s 
                    both part of us and greater than us—especially when everything else in the world can seem like it’s falling apart.”—Buzzfeed                    
                </span>
                <span>
                    “With each poem in her new collection, The Carrying, Limón counterbalances her most paralyzing fears with her ability to find 
                    small twinges of hope . . . Each poems is a widening lens of the world, an unburdening of the things we carry deep within ourselves.”

                    and power is at the core of her work. . . . For Limón, carrying both the joys and sorrows of a child-free life is a testament to the human

                    collection for a noisy, brutal time. The power of Limón’s unflinching examination of grief and loss is only surpassed by her love of

                    “What drives her poems—what makes her new collection, The Carrying, so moving and masterful—is her dexterity with voice and 
                    diction and her giftedness with metaphor. It is her deep wellspring of surprising and evocative images and her syntactic superpowers. 
                    Most of all, it’s her intellect and intelligence. The poems are keen reflections of a mind constantly at work, seeing and wondering and 
                    moving toward meaning but not always the meaning to which the poem and its reader thought they were headed.”—Poets & Writers

                    “Limon’s new poems in The Carrying are like a winter garden—somber, full of grief and patience, suddenly visible lines from here to 
                    there. To watch a poet in full possession of her power tending the earth with this kind of care feels like an inspiration that comes with 
                    a chastened edge: time, they remind, is all we have.”—Literary Hub

                    “All of Limón’s books have found a home on my bookshelf, each volume a heartfelt reckoning of what it is be alive. In her collections, 
                    I find a grace that demonstrates her versatility and wisdom as well as a ‘surrendering.’ She explains that the central question of her work 
                    is, ‘How do we live in the world?’ Yet she’s a poet as comfortable with questions as with answers.”—Guernica

                    “[Limón] might be the mom of Latinx poetry, and I mean that in the best way possible. . . . Limón is talented in a way that’s both 
                    intimidating and inspiring, and is definitely a strong pillar of contemporary poetry.”—Book Riot

                <span>
                    “Wisely observant . . . Limón’s poems personify the twinned-narrative of despair and tenacity that has become part of America’s

                    “Superb. . . . Although the subject matter is often mournful, the endurance of nature also comes to light. Even though an individual may 
                    perish, there is consistency in the life cycles of bumblebees, dandelions, and race horses—all of which are examined with gorgeous 
                    language and imagery that makes Limón’s collection hard to put down, even in the moments that cause a deep, sorrowful ache.”

                    between. . . . She performs a near-miraculous feat in balancing razor-sharp imagery with deep ambivalence. . . . The Carrying beautifully

                    and, as she writes, ‘all good things that come from the ground.’ It’s also no wonder that it’s full of the life that death makes. And the living 
                    that dying is. For this book is a garden. And like a garden, it will nourish you. It will feed you.”—Ross Gay

                    “In her powerful new collection, Ada Limón asks: ‘What if, instead of carrying // a child, I am supposed to carry grief?’ And later: 
                    ‘isn’t there still something singing?’ To which I say: yes. In these poems, joy and longing and grief sing with a music that
                    —regardless of what I am burdened or blessed to carry—makes me want to live passionately and fully in the difficult world.

                        “I will/ never get over making everything/ such a big deal,” declares Limón (Bright Dead Things) in her gorgeous, thought-provoking 
                        fifth collection, in which small moments convey “the strange idea of continuous living.” Materialist rather than metaphysical, these 
                        poems are deeply concerned with interconnectedness: “my/ body is not just my body.” Flora and fauna suffuse these poems, and the 
                        green-ness is almost overwhelming, but Limón duly confronts life’s difficulties. “It’s taken/ a while for me to admit, I’m in a raging 
                        battle/ with my body,” she writes, facing bouts of vertigo and struggling to conceive a child: “perhaps the only thing I can make// is 
                        love and art.” She also tackles such social ills as misogyny, racism, and war. In “A New National Anthem,” she writes, “the truth is, 
                        every song of this country/ has an unsung third stanza, something brutal/ snaking underneath.” Limón’s typically tight narrative lyrics 
                        feature simple, striking images, (“Women gathered in paisley scarves with rusty iced tea”), and her unsettling dream poems avoid 
                        becoming exercises in surrealism. Four “letter-poems” to poet Natalie Diaz also demonstrate versatility, shifting into looser 
                        meditations that sprawl across the page. “I live my life half afraid, and half shouting/ at the trains when they thunder by,” 
                        Limón claims, but this fearless collection shows a poet that can appreciate life’s surprises. (Aug.)

                        National Book Award finalist Limón (Bright Dead Things) here weaves nature, family, and grief into a stunning collection. Several 
                        poems recount the loss of the speaker's first husband from a drug overdose, but although pains are often described
                        —whether caused by grief, infertility, or a crooked spine—Limón's poems sing with the joy of life: "I wish to be untethered and 
                        tethered all at once, my skin/ singes the sheets and there's a tremor in the marrow." The poet mourns not only for people lost but 
                        also for irreplaceable things such as languages: "In the time it takes to say I love you, or move in with someone,/ …all the intricate 
                        words/ of a language become extinct." Many poems begin or turn on the unexpected, as in "The Vulture & the Body": "What if, 
                        instead of carrying// a child, I am supposed to carry grief?" Occasionally, there are too many unessential details, and although most 
                        of Limón's similes are strikingly good, she sometimes settles for the easy: "I saw seven cardinals brash and bold/ as sin in a leafless tree." 
                        Nevertheless, in accessible language, Limón writes movingly about finding the spectacular in the everyday VERDICT Limón's vision 
                        is realistic, at times bleak, yet these poems often brim with optimism, revealing a reverent, extraordinary take on the world. Don't 
                        miss this life-affirming collection.—Doris Lynch, Monroe Cty. P.L., Bloomington, IN
