                    Johnny O’Reilly has been discovered. In a town like Dingle, everyone knows a little 
                    something about everyone else. But dig a bit deeper, and there’s always much more 
                    to find. And when Detective Inspector Cormac O'Brien is dispatched out of Killarney 
                    to lead the murder inquiry, he's determined to unearth every last buried secret.

                    herself in a race with the detective inspector to uncover the dark, twisting truth

                    In 1917, Elinor White, the heroine of this smart, nuanced mystery from bestseller Winspear (the Maisie Dobbs series), was working in a resistance 
                    network in German-occupied Belgium, where she, then 13, was living with her 15-year-old sister and British mother. Elinor later emigrated to 
                    England and served as a British intelligence agent. Now, in 1947, she lives quietly in Kent, staying aloof from the inhabitants of tiny Shackleford 
                    until the arrival of Jim Mackie; his wife, Rose; and their three-year-old daughter, Susie. Jim has left London and taken work as a farmhand to 
                    break away from the crime family into which he was born. His brothers are now pressuring him to help them pull off their latest criminal operation. 
                    Trauma in Elinor’s past has made her acutely sensitive to children in peril, and she can’t resist trying to protect Susie and her parents. As Elinor uses 
                    her undercover skills and former intelligence contacts to try to foil the Mackie brothers’ plans, her sleuthing has unexpected personal repercussions. 
                    The chapters illuminating Elinor’s dramatic backstory add vulnerability to her characterization, enriching the suspenseful main narrative. This will 
                    please both Winspear’s fans and new readers. Agent: Amy Rennert, Amy Rennert Agency. (Mar.)

                        Winspear creates in Elinor White (The White Lady), a complex, endearing, achingly flawed hero. This is both fast-paced and thoughtful, bold and nuanced,

                        Elinor DeWitt's happy childhood in Belgium vanished in 1914 with her father's disappearance. She was only 12 in 1916 when she was trained as a 
                        resistance fighter, sabotaging trains and having to kill several German soldiers to protect her sister. She tried to put the past behind her when she taught 
                        languages in England years later but was recruited to help the Allies in the next war. A traumatic experience and a head injury ended her wartime 
                        operations. Now, in 1947, Elinor White lives in a cottage provided for services to the country. She's 43, a silent figure to most in the small village. 
                        A little girl, Susie Mackie, breaks through Elinor's protective layer. Then, Jim Mackie's family comes calling. They're a powerful crime family in 
                        London, but Jim escaped from them. They want him back in the family fold, and they threaten Jim's wife and daughter, Susie. Elinor turns for help 
                        to several of her wartime acquaintances. That's when she discovers the treachery and lies she never knew about during her wartime years. VERDICT

                    <span>
                        In 1947, Elinor White lives in a village in Kent in a grace-and-favor house, rewarded for her service to the crown, and keeps her own counsel. A 
                        farmworkers's cottage nearby is home to the Mackie family: Jim, Rose, and little Susie, who befriends the wary Elinor. Jim comes from a family of 
                        notorious London gangsters, and when they want him to return to the fold, they'll resort to violence to convince him. In interspersed chapters we 
                        learn about the background that Elinor keeps to herself: She was a spy during both world wars. Back in 1914, in Belgium, 10-year-old Elinor, youngest 
                        daughter of a Belgian father and English mother, tries to catch a boat to England along with her mother and sister, Cecily, before the German advance, 
                        but they're too late and return to their home, now under occupation. Some time later, a mysterious woman named Isabelle approaches their mother 
                        and recruits the two girls to spy on the Germans. It's easy for schoolgirls to appear innocuous as they count the number of trains that pass by their 
                        village. The sisters are trained in sabotage and self-defense. Elinor is a natural, but Cecily is not, and when Elinor kills two German soldiers trying to 
                        rape her sister, Isabelle smuggles them out to England—where Elinor faces another war, decades later, by working with the Special Operations Executive 
                        and returning to Belgium. Now she hopes her contacts from those days will save Jim from the clutches of the Mackie family. Her wartime experiences 
                        come back to haunt her, leaving her unable to trust anyone. In the end, it’s the gangsters who tell her the truth that will shatter her world and give 
                        her hope for the future.
