                <span>
                    Sometimes a book is a book and sometimes a book is a phenomenon. E. Lockhart’s 2014 Y.A. psychological thriller We Were Liars is, without a 
                    doubt, a phenomenon. . . . The prequel aims to stand on its own, and technically it does; you don’t need to have read the earlier book to understand 
                    this new one. But for the greatest enjoyment of Family of Liars, read We Were Liars first.” —The New York Times, on Family of Liars
                </span>
                <span>
                    "You’re going to want to remember the title. Liars details the summers of a girl who harbors a dark secret, and delivers a satisfying, but shocking 
                    twist ending." —Breia Brissey, Entertainment Weekly     
                </span>
                <span>
                    "This mindblowing YA thriller from E. Lockhart will make you glad you're the 99 percent...And that's about all we can tell you when it comes to 
                    the story of 'We Were Liars,' the book by E. Lockhart that everyone will be reading, and re-reading, this summer. It's twisty, it's mysterious, and it's
                     got a surprise ending that'll knock your socks off."
                    —Kat Rosenfield, MTV News       
                </span>
                <span>
                    "Surprising, thrilling, and beautifully executed in spare, precise, and lyrical prose, Lockhart spins a tragic family drama, the roots of which go back
                    generations. And the ending? Shhhh. Not telling. (But it’s a doozy)...This is poised to be big." —Booklist, starred review        
                </span>
                <span>
                    "Lockhart has created a mystery with an ending most readers won’t see coming, one so horrific it will prompt some to return immediately to page 
                    one to figure out how they missed it. At the center of it is a girl who learns the hardest way of all what family means, and what it means to lose the
                     one that really mattered to you." —Publishers Weekly, starred review

                        Cadence Sinclair Eastman, heiress to a fortune her grandfather amassed “doing business I never bothered to understand,” is the highly unreliable 
                        narrator of this searing story from National Book Award finalist Lockhart (The Disreputable History of Frankie Landau Banks), which begins 
                        during her 15th summer when she suffers a head injury on the private island Granddad owns off Cape Cod. Cady vacations on Beechwood every year 
                        with her mother, two aunts, and—most importantly—the other liars of the title: cousins Mirren and Johnny, and Gat Patil, the nephew of Aunt Carrie’s 
                        longtime boyfriend. The book unfolds two summers later, with Cadence trying to piece together the memories she lost after the accident while up against 
                        crippling headaches, a brain that feels “broken in countless medically diagnosed ways,” and family members who refuse to speak on the subject (or
                         have been cautioned not to). Lockhart’s gimlet-eyed depiction of Yankee privilege is astute; the Sinclairs are bigoted “old-money Democrats” who 
                        prize height, blonde hair, athleticism, and possessions above all else. There’s enough of a King Lear dynamic going on between Granddad and his 
                        three avaricious daughters to distract readers from Lockhart’s deft foreshadowing of the novel’s principal tragedy, and even that may be saying too 
                        much. Lockhart has created a mystery with an ending most readers won’t see coming, one so horrific it will prompt some to return immediately to page
                         one to figure out how they missed it. At the center of it is a girl who learns the hardest way of all what family means, and what it means to lose the one 
                        that really mattered to you. Ages 12–up. Agent: Elizabeth Kaplan, Elizabeth Kaplan Literary Agency. (May)

                        Narrator Ariadne Meyers’s tone is candid as 17-year-old Cadence Sinclair Eastman reveals ugly realities about her proud, wealthy family. She 
                        harshly judges her bigoted, manipulative mother, aunts, and grandfather from a secure position as one of the “the Liars”—the younger generation 
                        of teens who spend summers on an exclusive island. Soon Meyers reveals the opposing views of a teen named Cady. She suffers crippling headaches 
                        and is gripped by a tragedy that lurks at the edges of her unstable mind. Meyers’s expression of Cadence’s pain is raw and startling, as is the Liars’ 
                        tragic response to her unlocking of secrets. The impact of Cady’s realizations will be just as shocking to listeners, who may immediately return to 
                        Meyers’s narration of this haunting story. S.W. Winner of AudioFile Earphones Award © AudioFile 2014, Portland, Maine

                        A devastating tale of greed and secrets springs from the summer that tore Cady's life apart. Cady Sinclair's family uses its inherited wealth to 
                        ensure that each successive generation is blond, beautiful and powerful. Reunited each summer by the family patriarch on his private island, his 
                        three adult daughters and various grandchildren lead charmed, fairy-tale lives (an idea reinforced by the periodic inclusions of Cady's reworkings 
                        of fairy tales to tell the Sinclair family story). But this is no sanitized, modern Disney fairy tale; this is Cinderella with her stepsisters' slashed heels 
                        in bloody glass slippers. Cady's fairy-tale retellings are dark, as is the personal tragedy that has led to her examination of the skeletons in the 
                        Sinclair castle's closets; its rent turns out to be extracted in personal sacrifices. Brilliantly, Lockhart resists simply crucifying the Sinclairs, which 
                        might make the family's foreshadowed tragedy predictable or even satisfying. Instead, she humanizes them (and their painful contradictions) by 
                        including nostalgic images that showcase the love shared among Cady, her two cousins closest in age, and Gat, the Heathcliff-esque figure she has 
                        always loved. Though increasingly disenchanted with the Sinclair legacy of self-absorption, the four believe family redemption is possible—if they 
                        have the courage to act. Their sincere hopes and foolish naïveté make the teens' desperate, grand gesture all that much more tragic. Riveting, brutal 
                        and beautifully told. (Fiction. 14 & up)
