                <h3>Notes From Your Bookseller</h3>
                <p>
                    Drawing from Kiyosaki’s personal experience, Rich Dad Poor Dad examines the 
                    difference of mindset between the rich, the poor, and the middle class. It attempts to 
                    answer some of the burning questions that pervade each class and their eternal 
                    struggle with wealth, or lack thereof.     
                </p>
                <p>
                    April of 2022 marks a 25-year milestone for the personal finance classic Rich Dad 
                    Poor Dad that still ranks as the #1 Personal Finance book of all time. And although 
                    25 years have passed since Rich Dad Poor Dad was first published, readers will find 
                    that very little in the book itself has changed — and for good reason. While so much 
                    in our world is changing a high speed, the lessons about money and the principles of 
                    Rich Dad Poor Dad haven’t changed. Today, as money continues to play a key role 
                    in our daily lives, the messages in Robert Kiyosaki’s international bestseller are more 
                    timely and more important than ever.

                    Milestones   
                </p>
                <p>
                    While there is a milestone  to commemorate — and a new section in the book on 
                    Why Milestones Are Important — preserving the integrity of the original content is 
                    testimony to the fact that this book has truly stood the test of time. The sidebars 
                    throughout the book (that were updated for the 20-year anniversary edition) have 
                    been updated again, but the core principles that parents and grandparents — those 
                    who embraced Robert’s story and messages 25 years ago — are sharing them with 
                    new generations who have found that its timeless wisdom and no-nonsense lessons 
                    can be applied to anyone’s life and their vision for a future that includes taking 
                    control of their finances.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    People of all cultures and countries celebrate milestones. We use them to measure 
                    time, mark progress, reflect on the lessons we’ve learned, and celebrate 
                    accomplishments… and they give meaning to our life’s journey. They are a way that 
                    we integrate past, present, and future… looking back at where we started, where we 
                    are today… and the promise of all that the future can hold.

                    In the quarter century that has passed since Rich Dad Poor Dad was first published 
                    — 25 years since April 8, 1997 — so many things in our world have changed. But 
                    the one thing that has not changed is the pressing need for and the power of 
                    financial education. Money is still a mainstay of our lives, like it or not, and 
                    technology has brought both speed and innovations to the world of money. In an 
                    ever-changing world, we can all still get smarter when it comes to money… and 
                    learn as much as we can to secure our future.

                <p>
                    Today Rich Dad Poor Dad consistently ranks among bestsellers around the world in 
                    the categories of Personal Finance, Parenting, and Investing, has been translated into 
                    38 languages, and has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.

                <p>
                    Rich Dad Poor Dad is Robert's story of growing up with two dads — his real father 
                    and the father of his best friend, his rich dad — and the ways in which both men 
                    shaped his thoughts about money and investing. The book explodes the myth that 
                    you need to earn a high income to be rich and explains the difference between 
                    working for money and having your money work for you.         
                </p>
                <p>
                    In many ways, the messages of Rich Dad Poor Dad, messages that were challenged 
                    and criticized 25 ago, are more meaningful, relevant, and important today than ever.

                    <strong>Robert T. Kiyosaki</strong>Robert Kiyosaki is the author of If You Want To Be Rich And Happy...Don't Go 
                    To School? An international best seller, it received raves from thebusiness 
                    community and cold silence from the school system.

                    "The main reason people struggle financially is because they spent years in school 
                    but learned nothing about money. The result is, people learn to work for money ... 
                    but never learn to have money work for them." says Robert.

                    The Barnes & Noble Review
                </span>
                <span>
                    The advice that dads traditionally give is so commonplace, it seems almost clichéd: Go to school and do well. Save your 
                    money. Work hard, and financial reward will follow.         
                </span>
                <span>
                    What would you say upon learning that dear ol' Dad was dead wrong?  
                </span>
                <span>
                    In his explosive financial manuals, Robert T. Kiyosaki suggests that perhaps you shouldn't have taken Dad's advice, 
                    encouraging a new look at an old financial mind-set. The subtitle of Rich Dad, Poor Dad says it all: "What the Rich 
                    Teach Their Kids About Money — That the Poor and Middle Class Do Not!" Contending that the wealthy have learned
                     to make money work for them, rather than toiling for the almighty dollar, Kiyosaki reveals the secrets to success — his way.          
                </span>
                <span>
                    A millionaire himself, Kiyosaki's own experience plays a part in his controversial financial guidebooks. His real father, an 
                    educated, diligent man who became superintendent of education in Hawaii, gave his son the traditional fatherly counsel 
                    about hard work and financial gain. He died broke and bitter. Kiyosaki's "second father," his friend Mike's dad, was a 
                    high school dropout who taught Kiyosaki all that he now knows to be true about money. His "rich dad" lived up to 
                    Kiyosaki's affectionate name for him, becoming one of Hawaii's wealthiest men.                    
                </span>
                <span>
                    Robert Kiyosaki's philosophy — including the assertion that a high income does not a wealthy person make — forms the
                    cornerstone of his remarkable books, and his message is clear: "Take responsibility for yourfinancesor take orders all your
                    life. You're either a master of money or a slave to it." With Kiyosaki's guidance, explode the myth that you need to earn a
                    high income to become rich, challenge the belief that your house is an asset, and refuse to rely on the school system to 
                   teach kids about money.        
                </span>

                    These books — which exploded onto bestseller lists back in 1997 when the authors published them under their own Tech
                    Press imprint — will help anyone who's serious about claiming control of his or her financial future. Discover what to teach
                    your kids about money — and they will benefit in ways you did not.

                        Attitude towards risk determines acquisition of wealth, according to Kiyosaki, a financial lecturer and millionaire. Fear of
                        risk keeps you in the house-and-bills "rat trap," unable to escape. Short fore- and afterwords
                        by the Hawaiian-born Kiyosaki frame a serviceable reading by British actor Hoye. Sounding American, Hoye makes little attempt to add zip to this
                        economics discourse. Reading from a script, his narration is unmemorable, but it successfully conveys the intended monetary advice.
