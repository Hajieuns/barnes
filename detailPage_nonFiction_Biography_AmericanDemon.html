                <p>
                    The best true crime books read like a mystery novel. Daniel Stashower's American
                    Demon does exactly that. A 1930s cat-and-mouse plot unfolds as Eliot Ness hunts 
                   the Mad Butcher of Kingsbury Run. This is narrative non-fiction at its best and 
                   most suspenseful.         
                </p>
                <p class="bold">
                    New York Times bestselling author and Edgar Award-winner Daniel Stashower 
                    returns with American Demon, a historical true crime starring legendary lawman 
                    Eliot Ness.

                    Boston had its Strangler. California had the Zodiac Killer. And in the depths of the 
                    Great Depression, Cleveland had the Mad Butcher of Kingsbury Run.           
                </p>
                <p>
                    On September 5th, 1934, a young beachcomber made a gruesome discovery on the 
                    shores of Cleveland’s Lake Erie: the lower half of a female torso, neatly severed at 
                    the waist. The victim, dubbed “The Lady of the Lake,” was only the first of a 
                    butcher’s dozen. Over the next four years, twelve more bodies would be scattered 
                    across the city. The bodies were dismembered with surgical precision and drained 
                    of blood. Some were beheaded while still alive.              
                </p>
                <p>
                    Terror gripped the city. Amid the growing uproar, Cleveland’s besieged mayor 
                    turned to his newly-appointed director of public safety: Eliot Ness. Ness had come 
                    to Cleveland fresh from his headline-grabbing exploits in Chicago, where he and his 
                    band of “Untouchables” led the frontline assault on Al Capone’s bootlegging empire. 
                    Now he would confront a case that would redefine his storied career.       
                </p>
                <p>
                    Award-winning author Daniel Stashower shines a fresh light on one of the most 
                    notorious puzzles in the annals of crime, and uncovers the gripping story of Ness’s 
                    hunt for a sadistic killer who was as brilliant as he was cool and composed, a 
                    mastermind who was able to hide in plain sight. American Demon reconstructs this 
                    ultimate battle of wits between a hero and a madman.

                    An iconic police investigator on the hunt for a grisly murderer. Put that on a double bill. I’ll go make the popcorn.”

                <span>
                    “Stashower provides shrewd analysis and paints each scene with vivid, macabre details. You’ll sweat reading it.”

                    “Hang on for the ride…[American Demon] places you right on the scene, describing the ghastly horrors of [America's] 
                    Jack the Ripper while also recounting how crime fighter Eliot Ness started piecing the investigation together, one puzzle

                <span>
                    "American Demon, beyond its contributions to the genre of American crime non-fiction, humanizes Ness and provides

                        Edgar winner Stashower (The Hour of Peril: The Secret Plot to Murder Lincoln Before the Civil War) provides the definitive look at 
                        the case of Cleveland’s Torso Killer, who claimed at least 12 victims in the 1930s. The killings happened on the watch of Eliot Ness 
                        (1903–1957), who became the city’s director of public safety in 1935 after his much vaunted, and exaggerated, role in bringing 
                        Chicago gangster Al Capone to justice. The killer’s victims seemed to have been randomly selected, and their dismembered remains 
                        were left in a poor neighborhood with a large vagrant population. Ness’s failure to catch the killer was devastating to his career and 
                        reputation. Stashower presents a warts-and-all portrait of Ness, who achieved some success in combating corruption in Cleveland but 
                        was unfaithful to his wife and less than fully engaged in the hunt for the Torso Killer. Despite that, Stashower manages to engender 
                        empathy for Ness, who was out of his depth dealing with a kind of murderer law enforcement in general was ill-equipped to handle, 
                        and who died at 54 after being reduced to working in a bookstore to earn some money. The combination of a baffling unsolved crime
                         with a nuanced portrayal of an American icon adds up to another winner for this talented author. Agent: Susanna Einstein, Einstein

                        Stashower (Teller of Tales) traces Eliot Ness's career with a focus on the media-named Torso Murders, which shook the city of Cleveland.
                        Over a course of three years, citizens discovered bundles of dismembered body parts. Twelve killings in all were ascribed to the unknown 
                       assailant, dubbed the Mad Butcher, and only two victims were positively identified. Ness was famous for his work in Al Capone's downfall.
                        After some less prestigious work shutting down moonshine stills in the mountains, Ness landed a job that played to his strengths: 
                       Cleveland's safety director. Here he could modernize the police force, use his gang busting skills against the city's organized crime, and 
                       ferret out corruption within the ranks. Cleveland needed this, but what the city wanted was a hero who could stop the Mad Butcher. 
                       Stashower's Ness is a flawed do-gooder, frustrated by city politics, sullied by personal indiscretions, and taunted by postcards from the 
                       man he suspected was the Mad Butcher but couldn't prove. VERDICT Stashower was born in Cleveland, and his personal connection to 
                       the city breathes life into this well-researched and chilling account.—Terry Bosky

                        How a serial killer flummoxed one of America’s most celebrated law enforcement officers.

                    <span>
                        In his latest true-crime thriller, bestselling popular historian Stashower turns his attention to the so-called “Mad Butcher of Kingsbury Run,” 
                        aka the “Cleveland Torso Murderer,” a still-unidentified maniac seemingly responsible for a dozen or more murders in Depression-era 
                        Cleveland. The author’s focus falls on the investigative role played by Eliot Ness, who was named the city’s safety director after his success 
                        in Chicago as the charismatic leader of a mob-busting brigade. Stashower begins with a summary of Ness’ exploits in helping to apprehend 
                        Al Capone, then moves on to examine his extraordinary influence in Cleveland as a police reformer and his response, over several years, to
                         the sensation created by a series of grisly murders targeting the homeless. With characteristic skill, the author documents Ness’ involvement
                         in the case and, more broadly, his work combatting systemic corruption as he manipulated newspaper coverage and marshalled political 
                        support. Though he did not crack the case of the titular “American demon,” Ness was, as Stashower makes clear, undeniably heroic in 
                        confronting injustice. “Ness made a particular specialty of taking down crooked precinct captains,” writes the author, “an effort he likened
                         to cutting off the head of a snake. The campaign climaxed with the shocking downfall of…a captain said to be so powerful that ‘nobody 
                        went to the bathroom’ without his permission.” The author deftly sets Ness’ battles against institutional antagonists against an engagingly
                         told, suspenseful account of the search for a notorious killer. Stashower is particularly incisive in his explorations of Ness’ lapses as an 
                        investigator and his portrait of the crime fighter’s personal and professional decline. Rather than a simple idealization of Ness’ often 
                        uncanny efficiency, we get a nuanced text about a deeply principled and exceptionally accomplished—though all-too-human—reformer.
