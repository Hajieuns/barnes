                    Jon Meacham, Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer, chronicles the life of Abraham 
                    Lincoln with his trademark journalist style that is both accessible and engaging. 
                    Charting how and why Lincoln confronted secession, threats to democracy and the 
                    tragedy of slavery to expand the possibilities of America, this book is unlike any 
                    previous Lincoln biography.

                    A president who governed a divided country has much to teach us in a twenty-first-
                    century moment of polarization and political crisis. Hated and hailed, excoriated 
                    and revered, Abraham Lincoln was at the pinnacle of American power when 
                    implacable secessionists gave no quarter in a clash of visions bound up with money, 
                    race, identity, and faith. In him we can see the possibilities of the presidency as well 
                    as its limitations.       
                </p>
                <p>
                    At once familiar and elusive, Lincoln tends to be seen as the greatest of American 
                    presidents—a remote icon—or as a politician driven more by calculation than by 
                    conviction. This illuminating new portrait gives us a very human Lincoln—an 
                    imperfect man whose moral antislavery commitment, essential to the story of justice 
                    in America, began as he grew up in an antislavery Baptist community; who insisted 
                    that slavery was a moral evil; and who sought, as he put it, to do right as God gave 
                    him to see the right.        
                </p>

                    This book tells the story of Lincoln from his birth on the Kentucky frontier in 1809 
                    to his leadership during the Civil War to his tragic assassination in 1865: his rise, 
                    his self-education, his loves, his bouts of depression, his political failures, his 
                    deepening faith, and his persistent conviction that slavery must end. In a nation 
                    shaped by the courage of the enslaved of the era and by the brave witness of Black 
                    Americans, Lincoln’s story illustrates the ways and means of politics in a democracy, 
                    the roots and durability of racism, and the capacity of conscience to shape events.

                    Pulitzer winner Meacham (His Truth Is Marching On) more than justifies yet another Lincoln biography in this nuanced and captivating 
                    look at the president’s “struggle to do right as he defined it within the political universe he and his country inhabited.” Drawing sharp 
                    parallels to Lincoln’s battles against “an implacable minority gave no quarter in a clash over power, race, identity, money, and faith” 
                    and today’s “moment of polarization, passionate disagreement, and differing understandings of reality,” Meacham highlights Lincoln’s
                     struggles to live up to a “transcendental moral order” that called on humans “to do justice, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with 
                    their God.” For Meacham, Lincoln is above all “an example of how even the most imperfect of people, leading the most imperfect of 
                    peoples,” can bend the arc of the universe toward justice. Light is shed on Lincoln’s failures, including his 1849 effort to abolish

                        In his captivating new book, Jon Meacham has given us the Lincoln for our time. And There Was Light brilliantly interweaves the best of 
                        gripping narrative history with a deeper search for the complex interplay among morality, politics, and power in a life, in a democracy, and 
                        in an America ripped apart over slavery. Here Meacham takes us to the heart of the president who shaped events at ‘the existential hour.’ 
                        In doing so, he fortifies us to meet our own.”—Henry Louis Gates, Jr.

                        “Biography at its best, the great historian Barbara Tuchman wrote, paints an intimate portrait of an individual which simultaneously provides 
                        a sweeping view of history. With this deep, compelling work, Jon Meacham has achieved this gold standard. Written with wisdom and grace, 
                        his story of Lincoln’s complex moral journey to Emancipation mirrors America’s long quest to live up to its founding ideals.”—Doris Kearns Goodwin

                        “Jon Meacham has given us a Lincoln for our perilous times, a story in which slavery and racism are not an afterthought. You will not find any 
                        recourse to myth or legend in these pages. With the elegance of his pen and the power of story, Meacham draws a portrait of a complex man who 
                        answered the call of history.”—Eddie S. Glaude, Jr.

                        result is one of the most compelling and absorbing portraits ever crafted. This book instantly takes its place at the forefront of the Lincoln

                        With his latest work, Pulitzer Prize—winning biographer Meacham (the Rogers Chair in the American Presidency at Vanderbilt Univ.; 
                        His Truth Is Marching On: John Lewis and the Power of Hope; Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power) thoroughly examines the moral universe 
                        of Abraham Lincoln. This fascinating biography shows that Lincoln was a man with vices as well as many virtues. Meacham's writing is 
                        illuminating, and his sources help with that. For example, W.E.B Du Bois's and Frederick Douglass's mixed views on Lincoln heavily dominate 
                        the text. Why another book on Lincoln now? The author answers this question by giving readers a full understanding of the fractured state of 
                        the Union in mid-19th century America, contrasting it with the current divisive political situation in the United States of the 21st century. Lincoln's 
                        views on emancipation and the Union evolved over time. The author examines that evolution and shows readers why this matters. A brilliant 
                        chapter, "Abe Was Hungry for Books," gives much insight into Lincoln's early family life, his hunger for an education, and his beginnings as a 
                        reader. VERDICT A scholarly book on the life, triumphs, and heartbreaks of Abraham Lincoln's life, but general readers may enjoy it too. This 
                        is a title that will likely be a fruitful one for all levels of book discussion groups.—Amy Lewontin

                        Pulitzer Prize–winning historian Meacham follows Lincoln from his rural Kentucky roots to his assassination in 1865, paying close attention 
                        to the many influences on his ideas and values. As a young boy, the future president would memorize and repeat the sermons of local pastors,
                         and he read voraciously even though, other than the Bible, not many books were readily available on the frontier. At the time, writes the 
                        author, Lincoln was “far more attracted to reading, think­ing, and talking than he was to farming, rail-splitting, and hunt­ing.” Meacham 
                        astutely examines the contents of some of those books we know he read, showing their influence on his thinking. Allusions to some of them
                         cropped up in famous speeches later in his career. The author also traces Lincoln’s evolution from bookish farm boy to trial lawyer to 
                        politician, a progression aided by the rise of the new Republican Party, whose views largely matched his own. Meacham sets Lincoln’s 
                        development against the growing crisis of the slave states’ determination to maintain and expand the scope of slavery, a fight culminating 
                        in Lincoln’s election and the Civil War. The author provides in-depth analysis of Lincoln’s career as president and on how his thoughts on 
                        the issues of slavery and the status of African Americans changed during the course of the war, right up to the Union victory. Where those 
                        thoughts might have led him—and the nation—became immaterial in the wake of his assassination and the subsequent accession to power 
                        of those who did not share his experiences or vision—most notably, Andrew Johnson. While there are countless books on Lincoln, one of 
                        the most studied and written-about figures in history, Meacham’s latest will undoubtedly become one of the most widely read and consulted.

                        Pulitzer Prize winner Jon Meacham has written a biography of Lincoln as seen through the lens of slavery and the president’s evolving 
                        beliefs about it. It is a story that shows Lincoln as a real human being, not a mythical figure, and Meacham delivers it almost as well as he 
                        has written it. He does tend to fall into some odd phrasing, and it is sometimes hard to tell where quoted material begins and ends, but his
                         voice is clear and strong, and he knows where he wants his emphases to fall. The story of Lincoln is familiar in its outline, but Meacham’s
                         approach illuminates it in ways that will be unfamiliar and fresh to nonexperts. D.M.H. © AudioFile 2022, Portland, Maine
