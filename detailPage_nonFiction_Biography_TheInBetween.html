                    What would happen if we embraced end of life with curiosity and an open mind? 
                    Hospice nurse Vlahos does just that, and these stories of her experiences with the 
                    dying offer a fresh and hopeful view into that most dreaded stage of life.

                    Talking about death and dying is considered taboo in polite company, and even in 
                    the medical field. Our ideas about dying are confusing at best: Will our memories 
                    flash before our eyes? Regrets consume our thoughts? Does a bright light appear at 
                    the end of a tunnel? For most people, it will be a slower process, one eased with 
                    preparedness, good humor, and a bit of faith. At the forefront of changing attitudes 
                    around palliative care is hospice nurse Hadley Vlahos, who shows that end-of-life 
                    care can teach us just as much about how to live as it does about how we die.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vlahos was raised in a strict religious household, but began questioning her beliefs 
                    in high school after the sudden death of a friend. When she got pregnant at nineteen, 
                    she was shunned by her community and enrolled herself in nursing school to be able 
                    to support herself and her baby. But nursing soon became more than a job: when she 
                    focused on palliative care and hospice work, it became a calling.              
                </p>
                <p>
                    In The In-Between, Vlahos recounts the most impactful experiences she’s had with 
                    the people she’s worked with—from the woman who never once questioned her faith 
                    until she was close to death, to the older man seeing visions of his late daughter, to 
                    the young patient who laments that she spent too much of her short life worrying 
                    about what others thought of her—while also sharing her own fascinating journey.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Written with profound insight, humility, and respect, The In-Between is a 
                    heartrending memoir that shows how caring for others can transform a life while 
                    also offering wisdom and comfort for those dealing with loss and providing 
                    inspiration for how to live now.

                    Vlahos recounts her six-year stint as a hospice nurse in her often-moving debut memoir. When she became pregnant at 19, Vlahos intended to 
                    get an abortion, until she reluctantly attended a church service with her mother and was convinced to keep the baby. She pursued a career in 
                    nursing to support her son, and after coordinating hospice care for a patient whose scheduled provider flaked, was offered a position as a 
                    hospice nurse herself. Sharing experiences that complicated her once-agnostic ideas about death, Vlahos recalls how her supervisor insisted 
                    that a dying woman’s visions of her deceased sister were not hallucinations but evidence that she was “crossing over.” Another nurse 
                    claimed that dying people all “see the same thing” (their own deceased relatives) irrespective of “race, religion, or any other factor you 
                    could think of.” Vlahos eventually witnesses similar occurrences with her own patients, and dubs the “powerful and peaceful” nonphysical 
                    space that lies between this world and “whatever comes next” the “in-between.” Nonreligious readers may not glean much from this 
                    account, which veers into firmly faith-based territory, but Vlahos is a pleasant and earnest guide to the dying process. Readers anxious 
                    about their loved ones’ end-of-life experiences will find comfort here. Agent: Noah Ballard, Verve Talent and Literary. (June)

                        A hospice nurse writes of the difficult—but sometimes sublime—moments surrounding the end of life.      
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        As Vlahos tells it, she wasn’t cowed at the thought of tending to patients whose recoveries were off the table. With family in the funeral 
                        business, she writes, “I grew up with an understanding that death was natural, and it felt normal to me, not scary or mysterious.” One 
                        normal part of the deal, she notes, is that most of her time as a hospice nurse is spent simply on the way from one home to another, the 
                        places where most of her patients have chosen to end their days. That’s usually not fraught, though in one memorable account she tells 
                        the story of a man she tended to in a homeless camp who worried that she was in danger of being hurt in an auto accident—a prophecy 
                        that very nearly came true. Some of her patients are proud and aloof, others a touch disconnected. From all of them, the author gleans 
                        interesting lessons. One concerns “the surge,” a temporary revival of life force that signals not the restoration of health but instead the 
                        body’s last hurrah. Another is her conviction, after years on the job, that “we seem to have some control over when we die,” some 
                        choosing to wait until their loved ones have left the room, others until a loved one arrives from out of town. Particularly moving is Vlahos’ 
                        depiction of the stillness that comes when a person has died: Where it may have been two people in the room before, after the patient dies, 
                        it’s just her to document “the tangible shift in the air in that moment when a person leaves their body.” Although some of the author’s 
                        anecdotes run a touch too long and there’s a little repetitiveness to the book, one gets the sense early on that a person could do worse 
                        than die under her empathetic—not sympathetic, she takes pains to explain—care.

                        Tender and transformative . . . The great surprise of The In-Between is that it makes dying feel like a peaceful, dynamic, and nourishing 
                        event that can potentially transform the lives of those who are left behind. Readers will cheer on Hadley Vlahos and, like me, be forever 
                        grateful that she wrote this book.”—Christie Tate, New York Times bestselling author of Group

                    <span>
                        “Vlahos’s compassionate, beautifully written book contains profound wisdom. It is for anyone with an open heart who loves a good 
                        story and anyone who fears but would like to better understand hospice and the end of life.”—Katy Butler, New York Times bestselling 
                        author of The Art of Dying Well             
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        “Gentle and moving, The In-Between takes readers where few think they would want to go: deep into the world of hospice nursing. 
                        The combined beauty, faith, and compassion found in each patient’s death is meaningful and sublime.”
