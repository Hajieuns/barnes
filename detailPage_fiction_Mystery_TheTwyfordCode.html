                <h3>Notes From Your Bookseller</h3>
                <p>
                    We’ve been big fans of Janice Hallett since her US debut, The Appeal last year. 
                    We’re also fans of secret codes in books. We ARE booksellers, after all! But don’t 
                    believe only us. More than one or two or many people, actually, have likened 
                    Hallett’s work to Agatha Christie. Spoiler alert! We are pretty sure you’ll be wanting 
                    to read a third book after Hallett’s sophomore release.            
                </p>
                <p>
                    The mysterious connection between a teacher’s disappearance and an unsolved code 
                    in a children’s book is explored in this new novel from the “modern Agatha Christie” 
                    (The Sunday Times, London) and author of The Appeal.        
                </p>
                <p>
                    Forty years ago, Steven “Smithy” Smith found a copy of a famous children’s book 
                    by disgraced author Edith Twyford, its margins full of strange markings and 
                    annotations. When he showed it to his remedial English teacher Miss Iles, she 
                    believed that it was part of a secret code that ran through all of Twyford’s novels. 
                    And when she later disappeared on a class field trip, Smithy becomes convinced that 
                    she had been right.            
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, out of prison after a long stretch, Smithy decides to investigate the mystery 
                    that has haunted him for decades. In a series of voice recordings on an old iPhone, 
                    Smithy alternates between visiting the people of his childhood and looking back on 
                    the events that later landed him in prison. But it soon becomes clear that Edith 
                    Twyford wasn’t just a writer of forgotten children’s stories. The Twyford Code holds 
                    a great secret, and Smithy may just have the key.             
                </p>

                    “Filled with numerous clues, acrostics, and red herrings, this thrilling scavenger hunt 
                    for the truth is delightfully deceptive and thoroughly immersive” (Publishers Weekly, 
                    starred review).

                <span>
                    The Twyford Code is a page-turning mystery that's built for puzzle pundits and literary word nerds. It's also a story about literacy and
                    class, with a hugely endearing ex-con at the center of it all. Clever and refreshing, this book proves yet again that Janice Hallett has a 
                   knack for redefining how a mystery is told.” —Nita Prose, #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Maid

                <span>
                    “Extraordinarily clever, relentlessly fascinating, and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny—but, somehow, this unique mystery has tenderness, 
                    heartbreak, philosophy and universality on every page. The Twyford Code is immersive, and inventive, and even interactive. Janice Hallett 
                    has combined her brilliant imagination with a groundbreaking storytelling structure, and the result is an unparalleled reading experience. 
                    There are not sufficient words to tell you how much I love this book. Standing ovation to an instant classic!” —Hank Phillippi Ryan, USA

                    Culminating in a grand finale of twists and surprises, this book is one that even Agatha Christie would not be able to predict.”

                <span>
                    “The Twyford Code is a tour de force. Both a character study and an engaging mystery, Hallett has crafted a Rubik’s cube of a plot which 
                    had me reaching for my own pen and paper to try to decipher it. If you love acrostics, anagrams, or have every wondered what it might have 
                    been like to work with Bletchley Park’s code-breakers, this book is for you. A sure-fire hit and a cracking good read.” —Catherine McKenzie,

                    “The Twyford Code is a page-turning mystery that's built for puzzle pundits and literary word nerds. It's also a story about literacy and class, 
                    with a hugely endearing ex-con at the center of it all. Clever and refreshing, this book proves yet again that Janice Hallett has a knack for 
                    redefining how a mystery is told.” —Nita Prose, #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Maid

                    combined her brilliant imagination with a groundbreaking storytelling structure, and the result is an unparalleled reading experience. There are 
                    not sufficient words to tell you how much I love this book. Standing ovation to an instant classic!” —Hank Phillippi Ryan, USA Today bestselling

                    “Brilliantly imagined and stunningly original, The Twyford Code is a nesting doll of mysteries and puzzles, each as alluring as the last. Culminating

                    “The Twyford Code is a tour de force. Both a character study and an engaging mystery, Hallett has crafted a Rubik’s cube of a plot which had me 
                    reaching for my own pen and paper to try to decipher it. If you love acrostics, anagrams, or have every wondered what it might have been like to 
                    work with Bletchley Park’s code-breakers, this book is for you. A sure-fire hit and a cracking good read.” —Catherine McKenzie, USA Today

                        Framed as transcripts of 200 audio files recorded on an iPhone, this ingenious novel from British author Hallett (The Appeal) consists of 
                        recovered memories (perhaps false) told in the voice (perhaps unreliable) of Steven “Smithy” Smith, a recently released, now missing ex-con. 
                        Forty years earlier, Smithy came across a book by WWII-era children’s author Edith Twyford filled with handwritten notes. He showed the 
                        book to his remedial English teacher, Miss Alice Isles, who believed the notations were some sort of code. Indeed, Twyford may have hidden 
                        treasonous secrets in her books. Miss Isles (often transcribed as Missiles) subsequently disappeared on a school field trip to Bournemouth. 
                        Smithy tracks down a handful of other classmates to retrieve their “vanished youth” and solve more than one “explosive secret” from the past. 
                        Rumors of the audacious Operation Fish meant to move British gold bullion across the Atlantic during WWII blend with an account of one of 
                        Smithy’s most daunting heists and converge on a mind-boggling resolution that contains several bombshell revelations. Filled with numerous 
                        clues, acrostics, and red herrings, this thrilling scavenger hunt for the truth is delightfully deceptive and thoroughly immersive. Agent: Markus

                        Steven Smith (Smithy), recently released from a long stint in prison, has goals: never go back to jail, connect with his son, Max, and find out what 
                        happened to his teacher, Miss Iles, who disappeared decades ago. Using a phone from Max, Smithy records conversations and his own musings. 
                        Smithy warns readers early on that the recordings have been transcribed utilizing software that often misinterprets the audio. Forty years prior, he 
                        found a children's book written by banned author Edith Twyford on a bus and shared it with his teacher and class. Miss Iles read the book out loud, 
                        hinting that there could be a secret code in it that might solve a World War II-era mystery. Though she doesn't return the book, she takes the class on 
                        a visit to the author's hometown, but by Smithy's recollection, she disappears on the trip. Smithy interviews his former classmates, who all remember 
                        the day's events through their own lens; none agree as to what happened. VERDICT Hallett (The Appeal) creates a unique and imaginative mystery 
                        utilizing both an unreliable narrator and mainly epistolary format. The tale spins wildly, and readers are never certain regarding the facts. It's tough 
                        going at first but worth sticking with for Smithy.—Susan Santa

                        phone, so Judd's sophisticated voice seems an odd choice a the first-person account from a barely literate ex-con. With a neutral tone, Judd describes

                        Through a series of audio recordings, a former felon recounts his attempts to solve a literary code that may lead to stolen gold…or maybe that's all a 
                        red herring.

                        The novel begins with a letter written in 2021 from a police inspector to a professor, asking him to listen to a set of audio files that were found on an 
                        iPhone belonging to a man who's gone missing. What follows is a novel made up almost entirely of recordings and letters: recordings created by Steven 
                        Smith, who has recently been released from prison, wishes to connect with a son he never knew he had, and is haunted by a strange experience from his 
                        childhood that he only semi-remembers; and letters shared between Inspector Waliso and professor Mansfield in response to them. When Steven was a 
                        child, his teacher read the class a book by an author named Edith Twyford and then took them on a field trip that seems to have ended in tragedy. 
                        Trying to figure out what happened that day, he reaches out to the other children who were there and discovers that each of them has become fascinated 
                        with the “Twyford Code” that the author seems to have threaded through her novels. Twyford may have been a secret British agent during World War 
                        II involved in Operation Fish, a secret mission to move all of Britain’s gold stores to Canada for safekeeping. As he is drawn deeper into the intrigue of 
                        the code, Steven also records the story of his life—the deaths of his parents, his rough upbringing, and how he fell in with a family of criminals and 
                        eventually went to prison for theft. In a book with this many twists and turns, of course, there’s no way of knowing what's true and what's not, and 
                        Hallett continues to pull the rug out from under the reader every time we think we understand what's going on. The good: It’s complicated, in the best 
                        way, and the reveals over the last section of the book are truly gaspworthy. The bad: The recording gimmick does begin to feel a bit gimmicky, and this 
                        structure makes up 90% of the novel.
