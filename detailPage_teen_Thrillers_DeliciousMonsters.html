                    Daisy sees dead people—something impossible to forget in bustling, ghost-packed 
                    Toronto. She usually manages to deal with her unwanted ability, but she’s completely 
                    unprepared to be dumped by her boyfriend. So when her mother inherits a secluded 
                    mansion in northern Ontario where she spent her childhood summers, Daisy jumps 
                    at the chance to escape. But the house is nothing like Daisy expects, and she begins 
                    to realize that her experience with the supernatural might be no match for her 
                    mother’s secrets, nor what lurks within these walls...

                    A decade later, Brittney is desperate to get out from under the thumb of her abusive 
                    mother, a bestselling author who claims her stay at “Miracle Mansion” allowed her 
                    to see the error of her ways. But Brittney knows that’s nothing but a sham. She 
                    decides the new season of her popular Haunted web series will uncover what 
                    happened to a young Black girl in the mansion ten years prior and finally expose her 
                    mother’s lies. But as she gets more wrapped up in the investigation, she’ll have to 
                    decide: if she can only bring one story to light, which one matters most—Daisy’s or 
                    her own?

                    past, both timelines propelling the girls to face the most dangerous monsters of all: 
                    those that hide in plain sight.

                        recesses of intergenerational trauma with diligence and bravery. The odd ghosts, fearless prose, and raw character dynamics

                        Via dual perspectives told a decade apart, two Black teens strive to uncover the secrets of a haunted house in this gripping 
                        psychological thriller by Sambury (Blood Like Fate). The house that 17-year-old Daisy’s late uncle left to her and her mother
                         seemed to represent an answer to the family’s financial struggles, an escape from Daisy’s persistent visions of macabre ghosts, 
                        and a fresh start from her physically and emotionally abusive 21-year-old boyfriend, who recently dumped her without warning. 
                        But there is something sinister about their new home, and Daisy’s mother seems to know more about it than she’s letting on 
                        before tragedy strikes. Ten years later, the house is an AirBnB with a cult following that was spearheaded by college student 
                        Brittney’s emotionally abusive bestselling author mother, who claims her stay at the house—dubbed the Miracle Mansion—
                        “changed her for the better.” But Brittney wants to expose it for the “house of horrors” she believes it is by uncovering its 
                        history for her investigative web show, Haunted. Using speculative elements to cultivate genuinely terrifying scares whose 
                        perpetrators straddle the line between imagined and real-life monsters, Sambury empathetically highlights cycles of abuse, 
                        depression, and generational trauma. Ages 14–up. Agent: Kristy Hunter, Knight Agency. (Feb.)

                        On the heels of her boyfriend’s betrayal, Daisy and her mom get a long-awaited call: they’ve inherited the “Miracle Mansion” 
                        of Daisy's mother’s teenage summers and can finally move out of Toronto to start an Airbnb. In a parallel story line set 10 years 
                        in the future, podcast host Brittney and her partner Jayden investigate the same mansion for an episode in the newest season of 
                        their ghost-story YouTube show. As Daisy contends with her ability to see ghosts and all the things her mom isn’t telling her, 
                        Brittney and Jayden unravel Daisy’s story from the end, until the two narratives collide in a haunting revelation. This complex, 
                        multifaceted story is not for the faint of heart; its 500-plus pages are packed with visions of dead people and different types of abuse. 
                        The deeply creepy mansion delicately ties together two main characters who, despite being separated by 10 years and having very 
                        different backgrounds, are both fierce and compellingly imperfect, though one is perhaps less reliable than the other. A must-read.

                        Gr 10 Up—Seventeen-year-old Daisy, with ancestors from Trinidad and Tobago, has always been able to see dead people, but when 
                        she moves from Toronto into an inherited mansion with her mom, the ghosts inside invade her life in a completely new way. 
                        Daisy is hoping the fresh start will be a chance to put her most recent toxic relationship with an older man behind her, but instead
                         she is thrust into a haunted house with a monstrous will of its own. The house feels like an evil character from a Stephen King novel,
                         though the true villains in this story are more likely to use their power to groom, rape, and gaslight their teenage victims. Readers 
                        wary of maggots and slaughtered animals should also be prepared for some of the vivid imagery present. Because the house leaves a 
                        dead Black girl in its wake, a decade later the creative team behind a popular haunted house web series decides they will investigate 
                        to shine a light on the lack of concern over "Forgotten Black Girls." Even with the large cast of characters and dual narratives, 
                        Sambury carefully and clearly builds an intricate story that uses metaphors of gardening to spotlight the cyclical nature of sexual 
                        violence while providing a genuinely terrifying haunted house ghost story. VERDICT An excellent choice for fans of sophisticated
                         horror that includes both paranormal and real-life terrors, such as Elana K. Arnold's Red Hood.—Carrie Shaurette

                        Narrators Sandra Okuboyejo and Angel Pean deliver haunting performances in this young adult thriller. Ten years apart, two young 
                        women uncover the secret of a mansion in secluded Ontario. Daisy, whose family originally inherited the mansion, can see spirits.
                         Ten years later, Brittany wants to solve the mystery of who died in the house and write about it in her web series. Though the main 
                        characters have stark differences, both narrators use tones that work well for a murky mystery. Okuboyejo and Pean deliver 
                        paranormal intrigue that becomes clear over time with exciting reveals. The time jumps can be confusing at first, but the eventual 
                        merging of the stories is rewarding. G.M. © AudioFile 2023, Portland, Maine

                        Seventeen-year-old Daisy Odlin recounts constantly seeing, feeling, and fearing the dead; visions of the dead lying atop her are paired 
                        with memories of an abusive 21-year-old ex-boyfriend, betraying an unrelenting sadness that Daisy theorizes the dead feed on. With 
                        an estranged father and a volatile relationship with her mother, Daisy, whose family has origins in Trinidad and Tobago, doesn’t resist
                         when an opportunity arises for mother and daughter to leave Toronto for northern Ontario and an inherited home. A decade later, 
                        Black film student Brittney is investigating what actually happened to Daisy, her mother, and the notoriously deadly house for the web
                         series Haunted. Brittney’s own abusive mother was a guest there after Daisy’s mother turned it into an Airbnb, and it was a positive
                         turning point that she wrote about in a bestselling memoir that put the so-called Miracle Mansion on the map. In parallel narratives,
                         Brittney and Daisy—with the help of a documentary filmmaker and psychic, respectively—seek truths while struggling with the realities 
                        of their respective mothers. The paranormal logistics are complex, and while Daisy is at the center of it all, Brittney’s investigation cuts 
                        through to discover layers upon layers of trauma that imbue the house with its supposed supernatural, if not psychological, power. 
                        As the saying goes, haunted people haunt people.
