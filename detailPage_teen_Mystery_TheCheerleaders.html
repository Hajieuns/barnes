                    First there was the car accident—two girls dead after hitting a tree on a rainy night. 
                    Not long after, the murders happened. Those two girls were killed by the man next 
                    door. The police shot him, so no one will ever know his reasons. Monica's sister was 
                    the last cheerleader to die. After her suicide, Sunnybrook High disbanded the cheer 
                    squad. No one wanted to be reminded of the girls they'd lost.            
                </p>
                <p>
                    That was five years ago. Now the faculty and students at Sunnybrook High want to 
                    remember the lost cheerleaders. But for Monica, it's not that easy. She just wants to 
                    forget.          
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only, Monica's world is starting to unravel. There are the letters in her stepdad's 
                    desk, an unearthed, years-old cell phone, a strange new friend at school. . . . 
                    Whatever happened five years ago isn't over. Some people in town know more than 
                    they're saying. And somehow, Monica is at the center of it all.           
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are no more cheerleaders in Sunnybrook, but that doesn't mean anyone else is 
                    safe.

                    Weaving a deceptively intimate and intricate tale of mystery in a small community, Thomas (Little Monsters) continues to demonstrate command 
                    of both the inner workings of a teenage mind and the anatomy of crime. Monica,16, is a junior in high school, a member of the dance team, and 
                    the younger sister of Jen, one of the five cheerleaders in their town of Sunnybrook who, five years earlier, died within the span of three weeks 
                    under suspicious circumstances. Monica is also recovering from a disastrous summer fling with an older man. While searching her stepfather’s 
                    desk for his prescription painkillers, she stumbles upon a stash of letters that lead her to realize that the explanations given for the deaths of the 
                    five girls may not be true. Monica sets out on a quest to unearth what actually happened, enlisting the aid of Ginny, a young woman with a 
                    complicated past. Narrated in the distinct viewpoints of Monica—whose voice, unfortunately, is lackluster and even a bit shallow—and Jen, 
                    the novel brims with well-chosen, telling details in the tradition of strong psychological suspense that build toward a satisfying final chapter. 
                    Ages 14–up. Agent: Suzie Townsend, New Leaf Literary & Media (July)

                        Gr 9 Up–In Monica's family, they don't talk about her older sister Jennifer's death. It's been years since five of Sunnybrook High School's most 
                        popular cheerleaders died in seemingly unconnected events, but Monica's family never really processed their grief. On the fifth anniversary of her 
                        sister's suicide, Monica discovers a pile of anonymous letters hidden in her stepfather's desk. These notes urge the police officer to reexamine the 
                        evidence, hinting that the deaths were all connected. Knowing her stepdad is ignoring the letters, Monica decides to delve into the subject herself, 
                        but soon her curiosity becomes an obsession, driving a wedge between herself and everyone she cares about. Monica and Jennifer's stories are told 
                        through alternating chapters, creating suspenseful cliff-hangers, but also a variation in pace and genre. Monica's sections speed along like a frenetic 
                        thriller as she teases out her sister's and the town's secrets, while Jennifer's chapters take on the quiet unease of a drama as she responds to first the 
                        betrayal and then the death of her friends. Following its characters' temperaments and decisions, the atmosphere is at times eerie, exciting, and even 
                        frightening. Though the realistic depictions of abuse and sexual violence might be too much for sensitive readers, the ending offers hope of healing 
                        through a dark, but empowering conclusion. VERDICT This deliciously deceptive thriller and provocative drama is a must-have for high school 
                        libraries.—Leighanne Law, Scriber Lake High School, WA

                        Years after a series of horrific events left five young women from a cheerleading squad dead, the sister of one of them begins to suspect that 
                        justice has not been done.Sixteen-year-old Monica is beginning her school year recovering from terminating an unplanned pregnancy after 
                        having a summer fling with a guy in his 20s. The physical and emotional pain that she feels is only compounded by the five-year anniversary
                         of her kind and caring older sister Jen's death. Jen died by suicide, seemingly in reaction to two of her friends' dying in a car accident and 
                        then, just weeks later, two others being brutally murdered by an obsessed neighbor, who was then shot and killed by Jen and Monica's police
                         officer stepfather. However, Monica makes some discoveries that cause her to begin questioning this story, and she doggedly pursues each 
                        loose end she can find. The fantastical setup underpinning this contemporary mystery is intricate, and readers may struggle to keep track of 
                        all the characters as the narrative moves between the first-person present perspective of Monica and Jen's third-person flashbacks. Yet, it cleverly 
                        layers a veneer of doubt over each of the players in the story, effectively keeping the audience guessing until the very end. Monica and her family 
                        are white, and there is diversity in secondary characters.A busy, but satisfying, whodunnit with a solution as complicated as its premise. (Mystery. 14-18)
