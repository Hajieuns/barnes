                        British journalist and former Sunday Times dating columnist Alderton (Man Repeller) chronicles her love life in this wryly humorous 
                        essay collection. She writes about flirting as an awkward teenager via instant messages (“It was a complex Edwardian dance of courtship 
                        and I was a giddy and willing participant”), college parties (“I scan the room for boys with working limbs and a detectable pulse”), being 
                        single in a world that seems comprised solely of couples, and escaping a Tinder-facilitated threesome. In other essays she creates lists—things 
                        she’s scared of (plane food, STDs), the most annoying things people say (“how do you find the time to do all those tweets?”), safe topics for 
                        dinner conversations (“celebrity deaths”)—and deals with her own weight issues. Alderton writes with self-deprecating humor throughout, 
                        though her most moving essay focuses on the funeral of her best friend’s sister, who died of leukemia. A hit in the U.K., this clever collection 
                        will likely speak to American audiences as well. (Feb.)

                        Journalist Alderton (cohost, podcast The High Low) shares her coming-of-age story with wit and grace. As a teenager, Alderton was 
                        fascinated with boys and longed for adulthood. When she reached her 20s, the fantasies of her youth didn't quite pan out, as she shares 
                        in stories of dates gone badly, nights of drinking and partying, and failed relationships. Rather than get into the sordid details, Alderton's 
                        portrayal of this time is assuredly self-aware and reflective. She deftly balances more humorous anecdotes with an exploration of difficult 
                        experiences, including her struggle with disordered eating and the death of her best friend's sister. Everything that Alderton has learned 
                        about love is because of strong friendships with the women in her life, especially best friend Farly—and it is these friendships that 
                        provided the strength and support needed for Alderton to make it to her 30th birthday. VERDICT This relatable reflection on love 
                        and the importance of friendship is an international best seller, so expect demand from readers interested in modern life as well as 
                        intimate, confessional memoirs. [See Prepub Alert, 7/29/19.]—Anitra Gates, Erie Cty. P.L., PA

                        A Sunday Times columnist draws her coming-of-age story with tender flair.     
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        "We were the worst type of students imaginable. We were reckless and self-absorbed and childish and violently carefree. We were Broken 
                        Britain," writes Alderton, a TV writer and co-host of the podcast The High Low, in this incisive tribute to women's friendships. The collection 
                        gathers essays from a variety of eras of her life: her teen years, when she attended an all-girls school, cemented her fascination with boys, and 
                        dreamed about being a grown-up ("I was desperate to be an adult"); her chaotic 20s, which proved some of her fantasies wrong; and the 
                        dawning of her 30s, when she found some semblance of wisdom. The narrative is also a splendid mashup of recipes ("hangover mac and 
                        cheese"), hyperbolic group e-mails mocking the smugness of the coupled and the resentment of singles; and lively recollections on everything 
                        from awkward online encounters to body image and blackout drunkenness. Alderton paints British suburbia in hypercolor while drawing 
                        herself as a woman who's prone to excess. How her view of love matured is steeped in anxious charm, striking a clever balance between 
                        painful humor and self-forgiveness. "Dating had become a source of instant gratification, an extension of narcissism, and nothing to do 
                        with connection with another person," she writes. "Time and time again, I had created intensity with a man and confused it with intimacy.
                        " But it's the author's relationship with best friend Farly—"there isn't a pebble on the beach of my history that she has left unturned. She 
                        knows where to find everything in me and I know where all her stuff is too"—that inspires the most poetic passages. Whether excavating 
                        the turmoil of seeing Farly fall in love and get her heart broken, writing about the significance of her support when Farly's sister died, or 
                        revisiting the many everyday moments that have made up their 20 years together, Alderton's portrait exemplifies love.
