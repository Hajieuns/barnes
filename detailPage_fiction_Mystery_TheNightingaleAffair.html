                <p class="nonunder">
                    In this twisty new Victorian detective thriller from the author of The Darwin Affair, 
                    Inspector Charles Field hunts a serial killer with a sinister signature targeting 
                    Florence Nightingale’s nurses in Crimea and women in London.      
                </p>
                <p>
                    Who is stalking Florence Nightingale and her nurses? Is it the legendary Beast of 
                    the Crimean, or someone closer to home? In 1855, Britain and France are fighting 
                    to keep the Russians from snatching the Crimean Peninsula from the Ottoman 
                    Empire, and Nightingale, a wealthy young society woman, has made it her mission 
                    to improve the wretched conditions in the British military hospitals in Turkey—
                    despite fierce objections from the male doctors around her. When young women 
                    start turning up dead, their mouths sewn shut with embroidered fabric roses, 
                    Inspector Charles Field (the real-life inspiration for Charles Dickens’s Inspector 
                    Bucket in Bleak House) is sent from England to find the killer among the doctors, 
                    military men, journalists, and others swarming Turkey’s famous Barrack Hospital. 
                    Here Field meets both the famous Nightingale as well as Nurse Jane Rolly, the 
                    woman who will become his wife, and as he races to protect them, the prime 
                    suspect takes his own life.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Case closed. Or is it?       
                </p>
                <p>
                    Twelve years later, back in London, amid the turmoil surrounding the expansion of 
                    voting rights, women again start turning up dead, their mouths covered by that 
                    telltale embroidered rose. Did Field suspect the wrong man before, or is he dealing 
                    with a deviant copycat? Either way, he must race against time to stop the killer 
                    before more bodies are discovered, and before his own family gets pulled into 
                    danger. Populated by real figures of the day, from Benjamin Disraeli to novelist 
                    Wilkie Collins to, of course, Florence Nightingale herself, and steeped in historical 
                    details of 1860s London, The Nightingale Affair plays out against a backdrop of a 
                    rapidly changing society. Most of all, it is a pure reading delight, offering shocks, 
                    unforgettably vivid scenes, and surprising twists.

                    Inspector Charles Field makes a welcome return in Mason’s stellar second historical whodunit (following 2019’s The 
                    Darwin Affair). In 1867, Field is working as a private investigator in London when his latest case reawakens a past one. 
                    Tory MP William Hythe-Cooper has hired Field to prove his wife, Susan, is having an affair with Jeremy Sims, a political 
                    rival. After Field spots Sims fleeing the flat he reserved for his and Susan’s trysts, the inspector finds Susan’s strangled 
                    corpse in the flat with a piece of red fabric stuffed in her mouth. This was also the trademark of a serial killer known as 
                    the Beast of the Crimea who targeted nurses working under Florence Nightingale in the 1850s; Field was dispatched to 
                    Crimea to catch him, which he thought he’d done. The new crime leads Field to wonder whether he’s dealing with a 
                    copycat or the original killer. The action alternates between past and present, each switch masterfully heightening the 
                    tension. Mason’s superb plotting and well-drawn lead bode well for future installments. Agent: Gail Hoghman, Brandt

                        Set in the late half of the 19th century, Mason's second mystery featuring Inspector Charles Field (following The Darwin Affair) immerses 
                        readers in the gritty reality of the Crimean war and the politics of the era. Brimming with real-life characters from the time period, including 
                        the title's namesake, Florence Nightingale, the book's language and tone are firmly grounded in the time and place. Inspector Charles Field 
                        tracks down a ruthless serial killer who strikes fear into the hearts of women, most specifically, the Nightingale nurses. In Crimea, blood-stained 
                        murder victims are found with their mouths sewn shut with an embroidered rose. Excellent police work seems to tie up loose ends when the prime 
                        suspect turns up dead. The intrigue re-emerges 16 years later in London, when a body is found with an embroidered rose token at the crime scene. 
                        Is it a copycat crime, or has the true killer been lurking in the shadows for over a decade? VERDICT While it all too accurately portrays the 
                        misogyny of the era, this mystery will keep readers captivated and will be popular with admirers of Victorian detective novels.—Kelly Moore

                        The second historical mystery featuring former chief detective inspector Charles Fields revolves around the heroic work of Florence Nightingale.     
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        In The Darwin Affair (2019), Mason introduced readers to a fictional London detective who was the inspiration for the intrepid Inspector Bucket 
                        in Charles Dickens’ Bleak House—indeed, Dickens appeared as a character. Fields returns in this book, set in 1867, no longer a member of the 
                        Metropolitan Police but working as a private detective. He’s been hired “by a member of Parliament who harbored misgivings concerning his much 
                        younger wife,” and Fields quickly determines she seems to be having an affair with a politician of the opposition party. But Fields’ surveillance leads 
                        to his discovering her body after she’s been strangled. The most disturbing detail for him is a scrap of cloth, embroidered with a rose, left inside her 
                        mouth. He’s seen such scraps before, several of them, when he was dispatched in 1855 to Crimea to investigate a series of attacks on the nurses 
                        working there under the command of the famous, fearless Florence Nightingale. Although the wounded troops revere them for their loving care, the 
                        “medical men and the military brass had no time for Nightingale or her women.” When those women start to die, Fields’ pursuit turns urgent, and he 
                        returns to London only after the man responsible is dead. Or so he thought. Now, 12 years later, women are dying again just as the issue of women’s 
                        suffrage heats up. His experience in Crimea has had lasting effects on him, not least of which is his marriage to Jane Rolly, one of Nightingale’s nurses, 
                        but now it all comes rushing back. The book’s first part, set mainly in Crimea, is compelling, in part because Nightingale herself is a fascinating character. 
                        The later section is not quite as absorbing, largely because Nightingale fades into the background as Fields chases both the killer and the connection 
                        between the two sets of crimes. It does boast a blockbuster ending in subterranean London, rich historical detail, and a cast of real characters, from 
                        Benjamin Disraeli to Dickens himself.

                        “Because Mason places the killer and his excuses openly among his protagonists, and the threats to Field and his family are menacing and time-linked, 
                        The Nightingale Affair is at least as much of a thriller (think: ticking clock) as it is a historical novel. Yet the portrait of Nightingale both in her prime 
                        and as an aging yet still effective advocate is strong and memorable, giving the book its lively flavor that hints at all the shifts in women’s rights and 
                        health care about to unfold. Don’t expect an extraordinary police investigation here; read the book instead for the colorful storytelling around this classic 
                        “change agent” and her insistence on respect, honor, and care.” —The New York Journal of Books

                        Narrator Matthew Lloyd Davies performs this intriguing mystery set during the Victorian era in London. Intrepid PI Charles Field, formerly of the 
                        Metropolitan Police, is investigating the murders of several women. The crimes and the clues he uncovers remind him of a series of cases he was 
                        involved in the Crimea, when strong-willed, no-nonsense Florence Nightingale and her scrupulous nurses were stalked by a relentless serial killer. 
                        The self-assured Field, whom Davies voices as being from London, must sort through a multitude of suspects before the killer strikes out at the nurses 
                        again. Davies struggles with differentiating British characters, his sotto voce delivery is inaudible, and Turkish and Italian characters often mumble.
