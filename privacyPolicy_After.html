                </ul>
                <p>For your convenience, we have provided a summary description of each of these circumstances below:</p>
                <h3>Making a purchase or placing an order</h3>
                <p>
                    When you make a purchase or place an order in our stores, place an order online or purchase, download, rent or stream digital books, periodicals, and 
                    other digital content ("Digital Content"), you may need to submit personal information to us. 
                </p>
                <h3>Creating an account or joining Barnes &amp; Noble Member Programs</h3>
                <p>
                    In order to use Devices, certain Apps and features of Barnes &amp; Noble Websites, or to purchase or access Digital Content, you may be required to create a 
                    password-protected user account and provide us with personal information when you do so. Similarly, when you enroll in our Barnes &amp; Noble Premium 
                    Membership Program, Barnes &amp; Noble Rewards, Barnes &amp; Noble Educator Program, Em &amp; Friends – Friends with Benefits, or Paper Source Marketing 
                    Program, we will ask you to submit personal information as part of your member profile. We will store and use this information to administer the 
                    programs and services in which you choose to participate, and as permitted by this Privacy Policy. 
                </p>
                <h3>Applying for a Barnes &amp; Noble MasterCard</h3>
                <p>
                    When you apply for a Barnes &amp; Noble MasterCard, you will need to submit personal information directly to the issuer of the MasterCard. Personal 
                    information that you provide directly to the issuer is subject to the bank’s privacy policies, practices and procedures, not Barnes &amp; Noble’s. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, we disclose certain personal information to the issuer of the MasterCard in connection with the administration of the Barnes &amp; Noble 
                    MasterCard program. The issuer does not have the right to use the personal information we provide beyond what is necessary to assist us or to 
                    administer this program. The issuer is contractually obliged to maintain the confidentiality and security of the personal information we provide and is 
                    restricted from using such information in any way not expressly authorized by us.                     
                </p>
                <h3>Using Barnes &amp; Noble Websites, Devices and Apps</h3>
                <p>
                    Barnes &amp; Noble Websites, Devices, and Apps may provide you with the ability to enter (either directly, or by authorizing Barnes &amp; Noble to access the 
                    information from a third party such as a social networking site or application) certain information such as your contacts, calendar entries or photos, or 
                    images you may submit to us to help us locate products for you.
                </p>
                <h3>Contacting Customer Service</h3>

                    When you contact customer service, we may ask you to provide, or confirm, personal information so that we can better serve you.
                </p>
                <h3>Entering a sweepstakes or contest</h3>
                <p>
                    If you enter a sweepstakes or contest we offer, we may ask you to provide personal information so that we can consider your entry and, if you win, so 
                    that you may redeem your prize. 
                </p>
                <h3>Interacting with social media sites</h3>
                <p>
                    Our Devices and Apps may provide you with the ability to enter (directly, or by authorizing us to download the information from a third party such as a 
                    social media site or application) personal information such as contacts or lists of friends. These or related applications may also allow you to provide 
                    information directly to social media sites including information about your purchases, physical location, or comments. 
                </p>
                <h3>Publishing through B&amp;N Press</h3>
                <p>
                    If you elect to publish your content via our B&amp;N Press service, we may ask you to provide your bank account and routing information so that we can 
                    direct payments to you. 
                </p>
                <h3>Signing up for promotional communications</h3>
                <p>
                    If you sign up to receive promotional communications or notifications from us, we may ask you to provide personal information so that we can provide 
                    these to you. 
                </p>

                    Barnes &amp; Noble is committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the collection, storage and use of personal information of 
                    Minors under the age of 16, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Except as noted below: (i) our products and services are marketed for and directed towards purchase by adults or with the consent of adults; (ii) 
                    Individuals under the age of 18 ("Minors") are not permitted to use Barnes &amp; Noble Websites or Apps without the supervision of a parent or legal 
                    guardian; (iii) we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 16 or knowingly allow such persons to register 
                    for an online account or to post personal information on the Barnes &amp; Noble Websites; and (v) should we learn that someone under the age of 16 has 
                    provided any personal information to or on any of the Barnes &amp; Noble Websites, we will remove that information as soon as possible. 
                </p>
                <h3>Policies for Minors, including children under the age of 16</h3>
                <p>
                    Barnes &amp; Noble is committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the collection, storage and use of personal information of 
                    Minors under the age of 16, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We do not knowingly sell or share personal information about consumers under the age of 16.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If we direct certain Devices features or Apps to Minors who may be under the age of 16, we require the parent or legal guardian to provide verifiable 
                    consent to such Minor’s use of our products and services and our collection of personal information in connection with such use. In these cases, we 
                    require validation of credit card information already on file with us and we will then email the master account holder to give notice that we have received 
                    such consent. If no credit card information is on file, or if the credit card is invalid, we will not register that you have consented. With your consent, we 
                    may collect, use and share information regarding Minors under the age of 16 consistent with this Privacy Policy. Please see the sections above for detailed 
                    information on how we do so.

                <p>
                    If you are a parent or guardian who believes that your Minor under the age of 16 has submitted personal information or other information to us without 
                    your consent, please contact privacy@barnesandnoble.com. Once we verify that you are the parent or legal guardian, at your request, we will promptly 
                    provide to you information regarding what, if any, personal information we have collected about your child and how it has been used or shared. We 
                    will, at your request, remove personal information about your child from its database and instruct our affiliates to do the same. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are a Minor under the age of 18, you may request and obtain removal of certain content or information posted on Barnes &amp; Noble Websites and 
                    Apps by sending an email to privacy@barnesandnoble.com with “Privacy Rights for Minors” in the subject line. Please be advised that our removal of

                <p>
                    Certain jurisdictions outside the United States require that we have a lawful basis to justify our processing of your personal information. Where 
                    applicable, the lawful bases that Barnes &amp; Noble relies upon to justify a particular processing activity may differ from the lawful basis used to justify a

If we ask for your consent to process your personal information, you may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us using the details at the end of this Policy. Withdrawing

                    Some jurisdictions outside the United States have provided individuals with certain rights in relation to the processing of their personal information. This 
                    may be the case, for example, if you are located in the European Union or United Kingdom. These rights are not available to everyone, and they do not
