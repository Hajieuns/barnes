                    Discover untold secrets with this extraordinary memoir of drama and tragedy by 
                    Anne Glenconner—a close member of the royal circle and lady-in-waiting to

                </p>
                <p>
                    Anne Glenconner has been at the center of the royal circle from childhood, when she 
                    met and befriended the future Queen Elizabeth II and her sister, the Princess 
                    Margaret. Though the firstborn child of the 5th Earl of Leicester, who controlled one 
                    of the largest estates in England, as a daughter she was deemed "the greatest 
                    disappointment" and unable to inherit. Since then she has needed all her resilience to 
                    survive court life with her sense of humor intact.

                    A unique witness to landmark moments in royal history, Maid of Honor at Queen 
                    Elizabeth's coronation, and a lady in waiting to Princess Margaret until her death in 
                    2002, Anne's life has encompassed extraordinary drama and tragedy. In Lady in 
                    Waiting, she will share many intimate royal stories from her time as Princess 
                    Margaret's closest confidante as well as her own battle for survival: her broken-off 
                    first engagement on the basis of her "mad blood"; her 54-year marriage to the 
                    volatile, unfaithful Colin Tennant, Lord Glenconner, who left his fortune to a former 
                    servant; the death in adulthood of two of her sons; a third son she nursed back from 
                    a six-month coma following a horrific motorcycle accident. Through it all, Anne has 
                    carried on, traveling the world with the royal family, including visiting the White 
                    House, and developing the Caribbean island of Mustique as a safe harbor for the 
                    rich and famous-hosting Mick Jagger, David Bowie, Raquel Welch, and many other 
                    politicians, aristocrats, and celebrities.            
                </p>
                <p>
                    With unprecedented insight into the royal family, Lady in Waiting is a witty, candid, 
                    dramatic, at times heart-breaking personal story capturing life in a golden cage for a 
                    woman with no inheritance.

                <h3>About the Author</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Lady Glenconner</strong> was born Lady Anne Coke in 1932, the eldest daughter of the 5th 
                    Earl of Leicester, and grew up at their ancestral estate at Holkham Hall in Norfolk, 
                    England. A Maid of Honor at the Queen's coronation, she married Lord Glenconner 
                    in 1956. They had five children together, three of whom survive. In 1958 she and 
                    her husband began to transform the island of Mustique into a paradise for the rich 
                    and famous. They granted a plot of land to Princess Margaret, who built her favorite 
                    home there. Anne Glenconner was appointed a Lady in Waiting to Princess Margaret 
                    in 1971 and kept this role—accompanying her on many state occasions and foreign 
                    tours—until the Princess's death in 2002. Lord Glenconner died in 2010. Lady 
                    Glenconner now lives in a farmhouse in Norfolk.

                    "As her memoir makes clear, her capacity 'to get on with life and not dwell,' even in the most extreme circumstances, is heroic.
                    There is, nevertheless, a vein of quiet anger. The book is a retaliation as much as a reminiscence. It is also a finely drawn double portrait.
                    Margaret is in the foreground, spotlit, while behind her Glenconner's life plays out with such self-effacing matter-of-factness that 
                   it takes time for the reader to realise that of these two intertwined biographies Glenconner's is by far the more remarkable....
                   Glenconner has an eye for detail, and if her picture of Princess Margaret dwells on the positives, it makes no attempt to conceal the difficulties....
                   Lady Anne brings out a touchingly naive side of Margaret's character, visible only to an insider familiar with the realities of royal life....
                   Her book is partly a meditation on how much or how little she could have done differently. Although regret isn't in her emotional register, there is an 
                   unmistakable sadness when she remembers certain things, especially about her children, and her 'heart sinks.'"—London Review of Books

                        Glenconner, former lady-in-waiting to England’s Princess Margaret, provides a rare behind-the-scenes look at the British royal family 
                        in this heartbreaking and engrossing memoir. Born in 1932, the eldest child of the future Earl of Leicester and “the greatest disappointment
                         on behalf of her sex,” an entrepreneurial Glenconner found herself “in a great many odd circumstances” growing up, including a stint selling
                         pottery traveling from town to town, on her way to adulthood. In 1953, Glenconner served as maid of honor at Queen Elizabeth’s coronation, 
                        and in 1971, Princess Margaret invited her to be a lady-in-waiting, a position she held until Margaret’s death in 2002. Throughout this time, 
                        Glenconner met presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, and hobnobbed with celebrities including David Bowie, Mick Jagger, and
                         Raquel Welch at Glenconner’s husband’s private Caribbean island. Glenconner’s an entertaining writer, even as she describes being married 
                        to the volatile but charming Colin Tennant for 54 years, through his tantrums, absences, and affairs. She becomes wistful when she writes of
                         suffering through one of her children’s drug addiction, another’s death to AIDS, and one’s near-fatal motorcycle accident that left him in a 
                        coma for months. This memoir of life amid British royalty is full of understated wit and charm. (Mar.)

                        Inspired to share her stories by visits from Helena Bonham Carter and Nancy Carroll in preparation for their roles in the third season of 
                        Netflix's The Crown, Glenconner weaves a captivating narrative that hooks readers from the start. From her early childhood in Norfolk to 
                        being Maid of Honor at Queen Elizabeth's coronation to her position as Lady in Waiting to Princess Margaret and beyond, Lady Glenconner
                         provides an open and honest look into the private lives of England's royal family and the most elite members of society. The author's sense 
                        of humor shines through in her writing, bringing levity to some of the difficult times that peppered her life. While her lifelong friendship with 
                        Princess Margaret allows readers to see a different side of the royal, some of the most fascinating stories involve the author's husband, Lord 
                        Glenconner. VERDICT Highly recommended for readers interested in the British aristocracy and personality-driven memoirs. Glenconner, 
                        featured in the third season of The Crown, is a strong, intriguing woman whom fans of the show may wish to learn more about.

                        Readers who've already binge-watched the third season of The Crown needn't fret. Glenconner's meticulously detailed memoir of her life in
                        service to the crown will whet the appetite of anyone hungering for more tales of Britain's royals. Opening with her childhood on the fifth-
                       largest estate in England, the author chronicles her personal and professional life as lady-in-waiting and confidante to her childhood friend 
                       Princess Margaret. In Glenconner's capable hands, we learn about a motley cast of characters including her horse- and Harley Davidson-riding 
                       mother, a Scottish great-aunt who was a Christian Scientist, and the formidable Queen Mary, who intimidated her grandchildren but gave the 
                       author good life advice. A pleasing blend of detail and balance, the book provides sufficient glimpses into sumptuous palaces and shooting
                        parties to inspire awe and keen insight into the people who inhabit them. Glenconner's candor about wealth and privilege enables readers
                        to sympathize as she describes the emotional coldness of her parents and her father's undisguised disappointment at her not being born a
                        boy. The fun of racing with the princesses Elizabeth and Margaret through her family's palatial estate and various royal residences could
                        not make up for the fact that the author's worth—or lack thereof—was predicated on her sex and marriage. The poor-little-rich-girl story
                        is hardly new, but what makes this account fresh and poignant is Glenconner's use of affluent characters to demonstrate the extent to 
                       which class trumps power; even those at the top seem helpless to challenge tradition. By unflinchingly examining everything from her 
                       troubled marriage and her fraught relationship with her children to the solace she found in service, the author emerges as a flawed yet 
                       steely woman worthy of respect. In laying her life bare, she demonstrates the limitations of being a woman in the British class system, 
                       showing that privilege is no insulation from suffering or pain.
