                    AN INSTANT #1 NEW YORK TIMES AND #1 USA TODAY BESTSELLER
                    In the follow-up to It Happened One Summer, Tessa Bailey delivers another 
                    deliciously fun rom-com about a former player who accidentally falls for his best 
                    friend while trying to help her land a different man…
                </p>
                <p>
                    King crab fisherman Fox Thornton has a reputation as a sexy, carefree flirt. 
                    Everyone knows he’s a guaranteed good time—in bed and out—and that’s exactly 
                    how he prefers it. Until he meets Hannah Bellinger. She’s immune to his charm and 
                    looks, but she seems to enjoy his… personality? And wants to be friends? Bizarre. 
                    But he likes her too much to risk a fling, so platonic pals it is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, Hannah's in town for work, crashing in Fox’s spare bedroom. She knows he’s 
                    a notorious ladies’ man, but they’re definitely just friends. In fact, she's nursing a 
                    hopeless crush on a colleague and Fox is just the person to help with her lackluster 
                    love life. Armed with a few tips from Westport’s resident Casanova, Hannah sets 
                    out to catch her coworker’s eye… yet the more time she spends with Fox, the more 
                    she wants him instead. As the line between friendship and flirtation begins to blur, 
                    Hannah can't deny she loves everything about Fox, but she refuses to be another 
                    notch on his bedpost.                 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Living with his best friend should have been easy. Except now she’s walking around 
                    in a towel, sleeping right across the hall, and Fox is fantasizing about waking up 
                    next to her for the rest of his life and… and… man overboard! He’s fallen for her, 
                    hook, line, and sinker. Helping her flirt with another guy is pure torture, but maybe 
                    if Fox can tackle his inner demons and show Hannah he’s all in, she'll choose him 
                    instead?

                    Bailey’s second Bellinger Sisters novel (after It Happened One Summer) sizzles with romance and wit. Though Hannah Bellinger’s stepfather 
                    is a well-known movie producer, she’s determined to be successful on her own merit and begins her career in L.A. as a production assistant. 
                    When her director crush, Sergei, needs a location for his latest movie, she suggests using fishing town Westport, Wash., hoping to sneak in a 
                    visit to her sister, Piper, and Piper’s fiancé, Brendan. It proves logistically impossible for Hannah to stay with Piper during filming, so she asks 
                    her friend Fox Thornton, a member of Brendan’s fishing crew, if she can crash in his spare room instead. Hannah and Fox struck up a fast 
                    friendship when she visited Westport the previous summer and have texted every day in the six months since. Despite Fox’s love-’em-and-
                    leave-’em reputation, Hannah can’t help but feel there’s something real between them. But is she willing to risk their friendship and chance 
                    getting her heart broken or should she play it safe with Sergei? Bailey expertly captures both the intense chemistry and true friendship between 
                    Hannah and Fox as she takes them through humorous mishaps and miscommunication. This sparkling rom-com will have readers hooked. Agent:

                        Bailey's steamy, friends-to-lovers romance is the sequel to It Happened One Summer but can be read as a stand-alone. Hannah has returned to 
                        Westport and is living in Fox's guest bedroom while the film company she works for shoots in the small fishing village. The entire population of 
                        Westport believes Fox is a player—a reputation he's cultivated and earned with out-of-town hookup trips. But he hasn't had to "go to Seattle" 
                        since meeting Hannah a few months ago. Hannah knows Fox is a good guy. He's never made a move on her; in fact, she's been exchanging texts 
                        with him for months and considers him one of her best friends. Hannah, for her part, is nursing a crush on the film's director. She wants him see 
                        her as more than a useful assistant but hasn't gathered enough courage to act on her feelings. As Fox and Hannah spend more time together in 
                        Westport, their physical attraction becomes undeniable. The source of their overwhelmingly hot chemistry could just be their forced proximity, 
                        but they'll have to risk their friendship to find out. VERDICT Bailey's plot is fast paced with plenty of humor laced throughout. Fox and Hannah 
                        are well-developed, likable characters with emotional depth that will resonate; they have a lot to overcome, but readers will be rooting for them.

                        Fox Thornton is a king crab fisherman and the resident Casanova of the small coastal town of Westport, Washington. He’s the life of the party and 
                        has convinced everyone—even himself—that he’s not capable of anything more. Imagine his surprise when he strikes up a friendship with Hannah 
                        Bellinger. They bonded over a shared love of music when her sister fell in love with his best friend, and Hannah and Fox continue their friendship 
                        via text after she returned to Los Angeles, where she works as a production assistant. Hannah doesn’t even think of Fox as a romantic possibility: 
                        He’s unbelievably handsome and effortlessly self-confident, while she often feels like a supporting actress in her own life. When the film she’s working 
                        on begins shooting on location in Westport, Hannah crashes at Fox’s apartment. It seems harmless enough—she fancies herself in love with a co-worker, 
                        and she can’t imagine Fox would ever see her as anything but a friend. Living in close quarters ratchets up the emotional intimacy and sexual tension, 
                        leaving Fox and Hannah to each question long-held assumptions about their own worthiness as romantic partners. Fox has never had anyone that 
                        values him for who he is rather than how he looks, and the major arc of the novel is his journey to accepting that he has value beyond being handsome 
                        and charming. It’s an unflinching look at how toxic masculinity harms men, for Fox must unpack the weight of cultural norms and expectations he’s 
                        been internalizing since childhood. The romance between Hannah and Fox unfolds slowly, with side plots that keep the reader entertained while the 
                        main characters do the hard work of figuring out how to be together.

                        Seven months after the action of It Happened One Summer, Bailey gives listeners another glimpse of the Bellinger sisters. Hannah, a 
                        production assistant, misses her sister Piper terribly. After suggesting filming in the small town of Westport, WA, she impresses her director 
                        and crush, Sergei, and returns to town. But Piper's in-laws are visiting, which lands Hannah in the guestroom of the sexy fisherman, Fox, who 
                        has a heartbreaker reputation. The forced proximity is more than either can handle. Romance and narration are slow, and listeners may get 
                        whiplash from the will-they-or-won't-they game. The sex scenes are on fire, but some sexy talk is cringeworthy. The story is light on comedy 
                        as well. The prologue, a series of texts between Hannah and Fox, helps with the backstory and showcases the romantic undertones of their 
                        friendship, but it is not ideal for the audio format. Lauren Sweet's narration gives depth to the characters, particularly Fox. Kudos to Bailey for 
                        spotlighting the slut-shaming of men and the 10-year epilogue that helps wrap up this duology. VERDICT Optional purchase for fans of Bailey's 
                        other books or if romance circulates well.—Emily Pykare

                        Narrator Lauren Sweet draws listeners into the friends-to-lovers romance between movie assistant Hannah Bellinger and fisherman Fox Thornton. 
                        When her director is looking for a location for his movie, Hannah suggests the fishing village where her friend Fox lives. While Hannah has romantic 
                        feelings for Fox, he believes he is unworthy of her love. Sweet brings out all his insecurities and vulnerabilities. As Hannah fights to overcome Fox’s 
                        uncertainty, Sweet adds a lightness to Hannah’s flirtatious teasing. Sweet croons seductively as the two finally overcome their obstacles and give into 
                        their passion for each other. Sweet’s performance perfectly matches all of the emotions in this story. S.B. © AudioFile 2022, Portland, Maine
