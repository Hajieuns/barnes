                <p>
                    A powerful feminist fantasy set in an Egyptian-inspired world with breathtaking 
                    elemental magic and Sapphic romance. It’s a story of love, power, politics, and 
                    sisterhood, and it's also the first in a planned duology from a brilliant new voice.       
                </p>
                <p>
                    From debut author Hadeer Elsbai comes the first book in an incredibly powerful 
                    new duology, set wholly in a new world, but inspired by modern Egyptian history, 
                    about two young women—Nehal, a spoiled aristocrat used to getting what she 
                    wants and Giorgina, a poor bookshop worker used to having nothing—who find 
                    they have far more in common, particularly in their struggle for the rights of women 
                    and their ability to fight for it with forbidden elemental magic
                    As a waterweaver, Nehal can move and shape any water to her will, but she’s 
                    limited by her lack of formal education. She desires nothing more than to attend 
                    the newly opened Weaving Academy, take complete control of her powers, and 
                    pursue a glorious future on the battlefield with the first all-female military regiment. 
                    But her family cannot afford to let her go—crushed under her father’s gambling 
                    debt, Nehal is forcibly married into a wealthy merchant family. Her new spouse, 
                    Nico, is indifferent and distant and in love with another woman, a bookseller named 
                    Giorgina.           
                </p>
                <p>
                    Giorgina has her own secret, however: she is an earthweaver with dangerously 
                    uncontrollable powers. She has no money and no prospects. Her only solace comes 
                    from her activities with the Daughters of Izdihar, a radical women’s rights group at 
                    the forefront of a movement with a simple goal: to attain recognition for women to 
                    have a say in their own lives. They live very different lives and come from very 
                    different means, yet Nehal and Giorgina have more in common than they think. 
                    The cause—and Nico—brings them into each other’s orbit, drawn in by the group’s 
                    enigmatic leader, Malak Mamdouh, and the urge to do what is right.             
                </p>
                <p>
                    But their problems may seem small in the broader context of their world, as tensions 
                    are rising with a neighboring nation that desires an end to weaving and weavers. As 
                    Nehal and Giorgina fight for their rights, the threat of war looms in the 
                    background, and the two women find themselves struggling to earn—and keep—a 
                    lasting freedom.

                <span>
                    Elsbai’s rocky epic fantasy debut and duology launch suffers from uneven worldbuilding that is simultaneously elaborately detailed 
                    in its Egyptian-styled setting and cartoonishly shallow in its presentation of misogyny and societal inequities. In Ramsawa, the power 
                    of weaving—elemental magic granted by the gods to only a few—is barely tolerated, and only truly accepted in men. Young 
                    noblewoman and waterweaver Nehal Darweesh grudgingly acquiesces to a financially driven arranged marriage to Nico Baldinotti 
                    after the pair agree to a deal: she’ll allow him to keep his lover, bookstore clerk Giorgina Shukry, as a concubine if he’ll sign the 
                    papers for Nehal to attend the newly opened Weaving Academy. Giorgina and Nehal meet through the Daughters of Izdihar, a 
                    group of radical women agitating for women’s right to vote, many of whom are hiding weaving abilities. Their involvement 
                    opens themselves to the wrath of powerful men in a country on the brink of war, but the camaraderie of the group helps them 
                    find the courage to defy expectations. It’s a promising premise, but there’s a frustrating lack of nuance to the gender relations. 
                    Meanwhile, a slight secondary arc about Nehal’s realization of her own queerness yields a depiction of cultural homophobia as 
                    hamfisted as the rest. This disappoints. (Jan.)

                        DEBUT In Alamaxa, privileged princess Nehal and working-class Giorgina have two things in common: their rights as adults to determine 
                        their own fates are completely subjugated, and neither has been permitted training in the element-based magic with which they were both 
                        born—because they are women. By different paths, they make their way to the Daughters of Izdihar, a clandestine organization fighting 
                        for equal rights. That political agenda arouses the ire of traditionalists, and a neighboring empire is using the resulting upheaval as cover 
                        for their own agenda—subjugating their enemies through misinformation or war—all while taking out Alamaxa's best hope of victory 
                        before it ever has a chance to fully flower. VERDICT Elsbai's debut feminist fantasy, inspired by modern Egyptian history, provides an 
                        in-depth exploration of a society on the edge of revolution and war. The fight for women's rights is centered here, but it is clear that
                         more is yet to come in book two of this projected duology.—Marlene Harris

                        Two young women fight for their freedom in the midst of political upheaval, threats of war, and suspicions about the magic they wield.

                        In the kingdom of Ramsawa, based on a fantastical Egypt, Nehal Darweesh is forced to agree to a marriage to help her family settle her 
                        father’s gambling debts. Nehal, however, will not go quietly and manages to convince her new husband, Niccolo Baldinotti, to allow her 
                        to enroll in the Alamaxa Academy of the Weaving Arts to study waterweaving. Nico is equally uninterested in the marriage, as he intended 
                        to marry Giorgina Shukry until his father learned she was of a lower status. Giorgina, meanwhile, unbeknownst to her family, has joined 
                        the Daughters of Izdihar, a group of women from all levels of society fighting for their rights—to a vote, to education, to a life not 
                        subservient to men. Soon, Nehal too becomes interested in the Daughters of Izdihar and is drawn to their charismatic leader, Malak 
                        Mamdouh. Power, however, is not so easily given up, and the Daughters of Izdihar face both scorn and violence. Meanwhile, factions 
                        within the government and outside of Ramsawa’s borders continue to view the magical ability to control an element, taught at the 
                        Alamaxa Academy, with suspicion and fear. As tensions threaten to boil over, Nehal and Giorgina must both come to an understanding 
                        of themselves, their places within society, and their powers both tangible and intangible before they can finally and decisively fight for 
                        their own freedom. Reminiscent of Tamora Pierce’s fantasies, but all grown up, with a focus on women, magic, and political schemes, 
                        this novel is cleareyed regarding social issues, timely, and above all, an engrossing fantasy.

                        Narrators Priya Ayyar and Nikki Massoud accentuate the differences in the status of two women. In an Egyptian fantasy society, women 
                        are fighting for suffrage and control over their lives. Ayyar introduces the listener to Nehal, the daughter of a family that knows privilege.
                         Ayyar’s portrayal captures Nehal’s haughty persona; she is aggressive and ambitious with little thought to those who are not of her class. 
                        Giorgina, as portrayed by Massoud, also knows her place, but she is meek and unintrusive, as befits her lower class. Both narrators are adept 
                        at reflecting subtle changes in personality as Nehal and Giorgina interact with each other, with the man they have in common, and with men 
                        in authority. This debut audiobook is the first installment of the Alamaxa Duology. J.E.M. Winner of AudioFile Earphones Award
