                <p>
                    Ripe with hilarious dialogue, a cozy mystery hook and a delectably wry narrator, 
                    this is Maureen Johnson at her best. Add to that an immensely satisfying character 
                    arc and you've got Nine Liars in all its glory.

                    Stevie Bell solved the case of Truly Devious, and now she’s taking her detecting 
                    skills abroad when she becomes embroiled in a mystery from 1990s England. 
                    Another pulse-pounding and laugh-out-loud stand-alone mystery from New York

                    Senior year at Ellingham Academy for Stevie Bell isn’t going well. Her boyfriend, 
                    David, is studying in London. Her friends are obsessed with college applications. 
                    With the cold case of the century solved, Stevie is adrift. There is nothing to distract

                    and his new friend Izzy introduces her to a double-murder cold case. In 1995, nine 
                    friends from Cambridge University went to a country house and played a drunken 
                    game of hide-and-seek. Two were found in the woodshed the next day, murdered 
                    with an ax.

                    The case was assumed to be a burglary gone wrong, but one of the remaining seven 
                    saw something she can’t explain. This was no break-in. Someone’s lying about what 
                    happened in the woodshed.

                    Set in the Truly Devious universe, this scintillating mystery by Johnson (The Box in the Woods) follows Ellingham Academy senior and renowned 
                    amateur sleuth Stevie Bell, who feels rudderless with no college plans or cases to solve. She misses her boyfriend, David, who is in London, so when 
                    he suggests a visit, she and her friends hop on a plane. Upon arriving, David’s classmate Izzy solicits Stevie’s help. In 1995, Izzy’s aunt, Angela, and 
                    her eight housemates celebrated their Cambridge University graduation at a country estate. During a drunken game of hide-and-seek, someone 
                    murdered two of the attendees with an ax. The police assumed the killer was a burglar, who remains uncaught, but Angela once told Izzy she 
                    believes one of her friends is guilty. When Stevie confronts Angela, she denies the suspicion, but her obvious fright strengthens Stevie’s investigative 
                    resolve. Johnson delivers a meticulously crafted fair-play mystery that gratifies as a standalone while also forwarding the richly textured characters’
                     arcs, a treat for fans of the series. Distinctly written flashbacks to 1995 pepper the present-day narrative, creating resonance and investing readers 
                    in Stevie’s case. Stevie cues as white; the supporting cast is intersectionally diverse. Ages 14–up. Agent: Kate Schafer Testerman, KT Literary. (Dec.)

                         resonance and investing readers in Stevie’s case. Stevie cues as white; the supporting cast is intersectionally diverse."

                        Gr 9 Up—After solving the infamous Truly Devious mystery and then working on The Box in the Woods podcast over the summer, Stevie feels unmoored
                        and restless during the beginning of her senior year. Her friends are busy applying to colleges and seem to have everything figured out. And to make 
                       matters worse, her boyfriend, David, is studying abroad in London. When the opportunity arises for Stevie and her friends to study abroad in London
                        the week after Thanksgiving, she jumps at the chance. What is supposed to be a very structured school trip quickly unravels after the suspicious 
                       disappearance of the aunt of David's friend Izzy. Stevie's preoccupation with uncovering the truth behind the disappearance leads to a decades-old 
                       murder mystery involving the aunt and eight of her friends—two of the university students were found murdered with an ax in a woodshed. Stevie's
                        desperation to feel useful and smart, her incessant worrying about her relationship with David, and guilt over how she's treating her friends only 
                       intensifies her singular focus on the case and leads her to spin her own web of lies. VERDICT Johnson delivers another satisfying mystery, with 
                       diverse characters, authentic depictions of mental health, and friends holding one another accountable for their actions in loving, supportive ways.

                        So when David invites Stevie to visit him in England, she immediately accepts and, with the help of friends Janelle Franklin, Vi Harper-Tomo, and Nate
                        Fisher, gets a study-abroad trip approved for all four of them. Upon their arrival, David introduces them to his classmate Izzy, who has a story to tell. 
                       In 1995, a tightknit group of Cambridge graduates who called themselves the Nine arrived at a country estate for a summer getaway. The morning after 
                       their arrival, they discovered the mangled remains of two members. Although the police concluded it was a burglary gone wrong, Angela, Izzy’s aunt and 
                       a surviving member of the Nine, recently let slip her suspicion of a more sinister explanation for the deaths. Stevie’s deductive skills are put to the test, 
                       but other concerns—her relationship with David, graduation and inevitable separation from her friends, a persistent feeling of inadequacy—compete for 
                       her attention and occasionally push her anxiety, which she manages with medication, to the brink. The exploration of the importance of friendship 
                       (with parallels between the Nine and Stevie’s group) adds emotional vulnerability to this book, which has a well-developed sense of place and features 
                       the series’ signature humor and layered mystery elements. The cast includes diversity in race, gender identity, and sexual orientation.
