                <p class="bold nonunder">
                    A riveting look at the story of World War II and the Holocaust through the diaries 
                    of Dutch citizens, firsthand accounts of ordinary people living through 
                    extraordinary times 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on select writings from a collection of more than two thousand Dutch diaries 
                    written during World War II in order to record this unparalleled time, and 
                    maintained by devoted archivists, The Diary Keepers illuminates a part of history 
                    we haven’t seen in quite this way before, from the stories of a Nazi sympathizing 
                    police officer to a Jewish journalist who documented daily activities at a transport 
                    camp.              
                </p>
                <p>
                    Journalist Nina Siegal, who grew up in a family that had survived the Holocaust in 
                    Europe, had always wondered about the experience of regular people during World 
                    War II. She had heard stories of the war as a child and Anne Frank’s diary, but the 
                    tales were either crafted as moral lessons — to never waste food, to be grateful for 
                    all you receive, to hide your silver — or told with a punch line. The details of the 
                    past went untold in an effort to make it easier assimilate into American life.           
                </p>
                <p>
                    When Siegal moved to Amsterdam as an adult, those questions came up again, as 
                    did another horrifying one: Why did seventy five percent of the Dutch Jewish 
                    community perish in the war, while in other Western European countries the 
                    proportions were significantly lower? How did this square with the narratives of 
                    Dutch resistance she had heard so much about and in what way did it relate to the 
                    famed tolerance people in the Netherlands were always talking about? Perhaps 
                    more importantly, how could she raise a Jewish child in this country without 
                    knowing these answers?        
                </p>
                <p>
                    Searching and singular, The Diary Keepers mines the diaries of ordinary citizens to 
                    understand the nature of resistance, the workings of memory, and the ways we 
                    reflect on, commemorate, and re-envision the past.

                    This diverse and enlightening collection of excerpts from journals kept during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands is an essential 
                    contribution to the history of WWII. Drawing from an archive of more than 2,100 wartime diaries, novelist Siegal (You’ll Thank Me 
                    for This), whose Czech Hungarian grandfather Emerich Safar was a survivor, contextualizes her primary sources with exhaustive 
                    research and analysis of contemporaneous records, seeking to understand, among other questions, why 75% of the Dutch Jewish 
                    population died in the Holocaust, a higher percentage even than some Eastern European countries, including Hungary. The diarists 
                    featured include Philip Mechanicus, a Jewish reporter who documented his experiences at the Westerbork transit camp before he 
                    was sent to Bergen-Belsen and Auschwitz; two Dutch Nazis; a teenage factory worker without political affiliations; and a grocery 
                    store owner who became involved in resistance activities. Siegal uses their words to create a vivid portrait of the Nazi occupation 
                    as it unfolded, providing a wider lens than many Holocaust histories, and she incisively explains how the Netherlands’ willingness
                     to confront its complex Holocaust legacy has evolved, culminating in the 2021 unveiling of the National Holocaust Names 
                    Monument in Amsterdam. Even those well versed in the subject will find much to discover in this treasure trove of firsthand 
                    perspectives. Agent: Marly Rusoff, Marly Rusoff Literary. (Feb.)

                        “A beautiful, poignant book about the darkest period in modern Dutch history...This book gives a powerful voice to forgotten witnesses.”

                        “Nina Siegal has accomplished a remarkable feat. She has given us a day-by-day narrative of the Holocaust in the Netherlands by splicing 
                        together excerpts from a few of the hundreds of diaries stored in an Amsterdam archive...With thoughtful and insightful observations of 
                        her own, Siegal helps us understand how 75 percent of the 140,000 Jews of Holland, a prosperous and cultivated Western European 
                        country, could have been murdered, posing a warning for our own deeply fractured country.”

                        “The Diary Keepers is an astonishing, essential book that asks us to bear witness to an unbear­able history, even as it invites us to think hard 
                        about what history is—how it gets written, and what stories it tells. This book is powerfully moving and necessarily terrifying. By way of 
                        rigorous research and intimate storytelling, Nina Siegal brings us close to her diary keepers—making it impossible to turn away from the 
                        difficult, necessary questions their lives raise about survival, suffering, complicity, and memory.”

                        “Like an archaeologist excavating an ancient temple, Nina Siegal has dug up hundreds of stories of life under the unprecedented horror of 
                        Nazism, revealing the changing thoughts and shifting moods of heroes, villains, and victims. Until now, we only had a black-and-white 
                        image of these lives. Now, thanks to Siegal, we see them in living color.”  — Benjamin Moser, Pulitzer Prize–winning author of Sontag

                        merits comparison to Marcel Ophuls' classic 1969 documentary about life in occupied France, 'The Sorrow and the Pity.'"

                        policeman—it’s clear these diarists saw enough, Siegal writes, to respond to horror. She casts 'bearing witness' as an impure but 
                        essential act and history as mutable, a story told and understood not by one but by many.” — New Yorker

                        A collection of firsthand accounts of wartime experiences in the Netherlands.  
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        After the 1945 liberation, Dutch officials, anxious to document what happened during the war, pled publicly for writing, which
                        resulted in an avalanche of several thousand journals and letters now housed at the NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and 
                       Genocide Studies in Amsterdam. With few exceptions, such as Anne Frank’s diary, they possess little literary value, but 
                       journalist Siegal’s excerpts provide a vivid portrait of the daily lives of “victims and collaborators, bystanders and 
                       participants.” Three of her leading diarists were Jews, two enthusiastic Dutch Nazis, one a member of the resistance, and one 
                       a teenager with no political views. She also includes shorter dispatches from a dozen others. Hitler considered Holland a 
                       quasi-Nordic nation, so, after the bloody 1940 conquest, Nazi occupation was relatively benign. During the first year, there 
                       were anti-German demonstrations and strikes to protest German exactions, and when local antisemitic gangs began their attacks,
                        many young Christian men fought alongside Jews. Matters settled down once the Nazi grip tightened, whereupon, although there 
                       was a modest resistance, most citizens and police cooperated in handing over Jews. When it became clear that the Nazis intended to 
                       kill them, about 15% went into hiding. Ultimately, 75% of the 140,000 Dutch Jews were killed in five years. Nazi policy deteriorated
                        in the fall of 1944, when the Dutch welcomed the failed Allied invasion. Food deliveries were stopped, and a famine followed; thousands
                        died of starvation. Siegal’s emphasis on the Holocaust makes for painful reading, but these are private writings, so much of the text 
                       records repetitious, day-to-day concerns, some of which readers may skim. Fortunately, the author steps in frequently to summarize
                        events and describe her own life (she is the granddaughter of Holocaust survivors), and she concludes with an insightful account of how 
                       postwar Holland recalled the experience, a section that includes a surprising number of interviews with survivors and their descendants.
