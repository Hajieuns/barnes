                <p>
                    Sweeping and romantic, Divine Rivals is the explosive kick off to a new series from 
                    Rebecca Ross. Pick up this inventive and harrowing story about two young 
                    journalists and a war that has the fate of mankind hanging in the balance.         
                </p>
                <p class="bold">
                    When two young rival journalists find love through a magical connection, they 
                    must face the depths of hell, in a war among gods, to seal their fate forever.

                    After centuries of sleep, the gods are warring again. But eighteen-year-old Iris 
                    Winnow just wants to hold her family together. Her mother is suffering from 
                    addiction and her brother is missing from the front lines. Her best bet is to win the 
                    columnist promotion at the Oath Gazette.             
                </p>
                <p>
                    To combat her worries, Iris writes letters to her brother and slips them beneath her 
                    wardrobe door, where they vanish—into the hands of Roman Kitt, her cold and 
                    handsome rival at the paper. When he anonymously writes Iris back, the two of 
                    them forge a connection that will follow Iris all the way to the front lines of battle: 
                    for her brother, the fate of mankind, and love.

                    In this affecting fantasy duology opener from Ross (the Elements of Cadence duology), 18-year-old Iris Winnow’s life is upended when 
                    long-slumbering gods wake and begin battling for control of the fictional land of Cambria, using human armies as proxies. After Iris’s 
                    brother, Forest, enlists to fight, and her mother is fired from her job for drinking while at work, Iris must quit school to help make ends 
                    meet. Her new writing position at local newspaper Oath Gazette doesn’t pay much, prompting Iris to campaign for a promotion. 
                    That won’t be easy, however, given the talent and connections of her 19-year-old rival, Roman Kitt. At night, Iris writes to Forest 
                    using an old typewriter and, since he has no mailing address, slips the letters under her wardrobe door, after which they mysteriously 
                    disappear. Iris hopes that Forest is somehow receiving her correspondence, but in truth, Roman is. Moved by her words, Roman 
                    responds under a pseudonym, triggering a chain of life-altering events. Ross elevates predictable plotting with inventive worldbuilding, 
                    nuanced characterizations, and prose by turns dreamy and atmospherically tense. The result is an ardent romance and a harrowing 
                    exploration of war’s horrors and heartbreaks. The protagonists cue as white. Ages 13–up. Agent: Suzie Townsend, New Leaf Literary & Media. (Apr.)

                        mystique shimmers just beneath the surface. Hers is a brilliant blend of whimsy and heart.”

                        Gr 9 Up—Aspiring newspaper columnists at the Oath Gazette, Iris and Roman are competing for the same job. Circumstance has pushed Iris's family 
                        away, forcing her to stand alone on the edge of poverty, while Roman's wealthy father pulls the strings to every aspect of his life. When Iris tries to write 
                        a letter to her brother on the front lines, it gets magically redirected to Roman, who writes back anonymously. When the final threads tying her to the city 
                        of Oath are cut, Iris quits her job and heads to the war front to discover what's really happened to the soldiers who go missing there, including her brother. 
                        Ross paints a vivid historical picture with magic adding color to the worldbuilding without overtaking it. Iris is a heroine to root for as she braves the front 
                        lines, and Roman goes on his own journey towards independence; their characters are rich and well balanced in the first half of the novel, but once Iris goes 
                        to the front, Roman's perspective falls away. The budding romance feels lopsided as Roman holds all the power at the start of their relationship, as a well-
                        educated man from a wealthy, influential family who knows who he's writing to. Reveals and secrets from Iris's investigation add more plotlines to set up 
                        the sequel, at the expense of a full arc. VERDICT More historical than fantasy, this is a rivals-to-lovers romance that requires a sequel to be satisfying.

                        A war between gods plays havoc with mortals and their everyday lives.

                    <span>
                        In a time of typewriters and steam engines, Iris Winnow awaits word from her older brother, who has enlisted on the side of Enva the Skyward goddess. 
                        Alcohol abuse led to her mother’s losing her job, and Iris has dropped out of school and found work utilizing her writing skills at the Oath Gazette. 
                        Hiding the stress of her home issues behind a brave face, Iris competes for valuable assignments that may one day earn her the coveted columnist position. 
                        Her rival for the job is handsome and wealthy Roman Kitt, whose prose entrances her so much she avoids reading his articles. At home, she writes cathartic 
                        letters to her brother, never posting them but instead placing them in her wardrobe, where they vanish overnight. One day Iris receives a reply, which, along 
                        with other events, pushes her to make dramatic life decisions. Magic plays a quiet role in this story, and readers may for a time forget there is anything 
                        supernatural going on. This is more of a wartime tale of broken families, inspired youths, and higher powers using people as pawns. It flirts with clichéd 
                        tropes but also takes some startling turns. Main characters are assumed White; same-sex marriages and gender equality at the warfront appear to be the 
                        norm in this world.

                        Rebecca Norfolk and Alex Wingfield narrate the first in a fantasy series. As warring gods tear apart their world, young newspaper reporters Iris and Roman 
                        take their rivalry from the newsroom to the front. Iris slips letters to her missing brother into her closet, where they magically disappear. 
                        When she mysteriously receives a reply, a relationship develops between the two correspondents. Norfolk narrates the bulk of the story from Iris's point of 
                        view. Her emotional portrayal of the older teen captures Iris's myriad experiences. Wingfield's style is well suited to Roman's snippets of narration. This
