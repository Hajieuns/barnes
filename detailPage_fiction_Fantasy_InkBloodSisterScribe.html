                    here. . . . It’s simply a delight from start to finish.” – AMAL EL-MOHTAR, New

                    In this spellbinding debut novel, two estranged half-sisters tasked with guarding 
                    their family’s library of magical books must work together to unravel a deadly 
                    secret at the heart of their collection—a tale of familial loyalty and betrayal, and the 
                    pursuit of magic and power.

                    For generations, the Kalotay family has guarded a collection of ancient and rare 
                    books. Books that let a person walk through walls or manipulate the elements—
                    books of magic that half-sisters Joanna and Esther have been raised to revere and 
                    protect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All magic comes with a price, though, and for years the sisters have been separated. 
                    Esther has fled to a remote base in Antarctica to escape the fate that killed her own 
                    mother, and Joanna’s isolated herself in their family home in Vermont, devoting her 
                    life to the study of these cherished volumes. But after their father dies suddenly 
                    while reading a book Joanna has never seen before, the sisters must reunite to 
                    preserve their family legacy. In the process, they’ll uncover a world of magic far 
                    bigger and more dangerous than they ever imagined, and all the secrets their parents 
                    kept hidden; secrets that span centuries, continents, and even other libraries . . .

                <p>
                    In the great tradition of Ninth House, The Magicians, and Practical Magic, this is a 
                    suspenseful and richly atmospheric novel that draws readers into a vast world filled 
                    with mystery and magic, romance, and intrigue—and marks the debut of an 
                    extraordinary new voice in speculative fiction.

                    Törzs’s spellbinding fantasy debut imagines a parallel Earth where gruesome magical spell books are written with the blood and 
                    bodies of people known as Scribes. Nicholas is tired of living in the gilded cage that is the Library, home to the world’s largest 
                    collection of spellbooks, where he is routinely bled by his overbearing uncle, Richard Maxwell, to fulfill magical commissions. 
                    Elsewhere, Joanna Kalotay steadfastly guards a small collection of spellbooks of her own, barely leaving home and nightly setting 
                    protection charms to prevent detection. Meanwhile, her estranged sister, Esther, is constantly on the move, acting on a warning 
                    from their late father. She must relocate every year on November 2 “or the people who killed your mother will come for you, too. 
                    And not only you, Esther. They’ll come for your sister.” But when a mysterious note tells Esther it’s time to finally return home to 
                    Joanna, she risks everything to reunite with her sister. Unraveling the twisty mysteries that connect Nicholas to the Kalotay sisters 
                    and dismantling the dark constraints on their lives keep both characters and readers guessing throughout. Meanwhile, threads of 
                    hope and love keep the grimly gorgeous worldbuilding from growing too dark. Törzs’s lyrical, idiosyncratic prose (at one point, 
                    the sky is described as “so pale it seemed infected”) elevates proceedings. This is a must-read. Agent: Claudia Ballard, WME. (June)

                        "Ink Blood Sister Scribe is so many things at once: an adventure, a puzzle, a twisty thriller, and a tender romance. It's a magical book 
                        about the magic of books; I adored it."  — Alix E. Harrow, New York Times bestselling author of The Once and Future Witches

                        “A twisty and thrilling fantasy in which both the magic and the characters have real complexity, real shadows. If, like me, you’re a fan of

                        “The best kind of books do not simply expand our world, they let in light from new ones. Törzs's spellbinding Ink Blood Sister Scribe 
                        embodies that completely. Chilling and charming in equal parts, Törzs's debut is a love letter to stories everywhere." — Roshani Chokshi,

                        from reading them. Go beyond the magic and you're left with a heartbreaking tale of family where truth blurs with lies, and blood isn't 
                        thick enough. A bold, new novel from an extraordinary new voice."

                        DEBUT Törzs's debut novel features a wonderfully realized and atmospheric world and a plot filled with unexpected twists. 
                        It takes place in modern-day Vermont, where a family plagued by tragedy, including two half-sisters, guards a collection of books that 
                        contain, and are themselves, spells. Esther, the eldest sister, is immune to magic, and her presence counteracts the protection wards over 
                        the collection. To save her sister, the books, and likely herself, she has fled and changes locations every year (living most recently in 
                        Antarctica). Meanwhile, in London, lives Nicholas, a scribe who inherited his family's legacy of writing the spell books, as well as the 
                        burden of protecting them. But from what, or whom? Over time he learns the perceived danger might not be as he thought.
                         VERDICT Törzs does a fantastic job creating a gripping and suspenseful story that keeps readers on their toes and wanting more. 
                        Fans of The Ninth House by Leigh Bardugo and The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern will love this magic- and suspense-filled novel.

                        The magic of Saskia Maarleveld's narration grounds this debut novel featuring the Kalotay half sisters, Joanna and Esther. Joanna is 
                        guardian of a vast and hidden collection of magical spell books, written by Scribes in their own blood. Esther's works to keep Joanna 
                        and the collection safe. But someone desperately wants the magical library and will do anything to find and keep it. 
                        Maarleveld captures the sisters' determination to carry out their missions. But when Esther is summoned home from Antarctica, long 
                        held secrets will come out, and the truth of whom they can trust will become clear. Maarleveld seamlessly portrays the inner turbulence 
                        of each character and keeps the suspense taut with her insightful interpretation. L.M.G. © AudioFile 2023, Portland, Maine

                        Two half sisters work to protect their dead father’s collection of magical books in Törzs’ bewitching debut.

                        Esther and Joanna Kalotay are keepers of an impossible secret: that magic exists, and it's channeled through certain enchanted books. 
                        Esther and Joanna’s father, Abe, is fanatical about his collection of these books, but despite having devoted his life to magic, he's never 
                        been able to figure out how they were written. One terrible day, he tries to enact a spell from a mysterious book and is killed. 
                        This tragedy leaves Joanna, who shares her father’s ability to sense magic humming in a book, to tend to the library. Before he died, 
                        Abe had warned Esther, who is mysteriously immune to all magic, that she must take care never to stay anywhere for longer than a 
                        year, always leaving on Nov. 2, or she will risk being hunted down and killed by the same people who murdered her mother. Only 
                        once did Esther test this rule, and after barely escaping a strange man bent on killing her in her bedroom, she’s careful not to put down 
                        roots. But when Esther’s travels take her to a science station on Antarctica, she discovers that someone who knows about magic has 
                        finally found her, and her only chance to save herself is to trust a stranger who sent her a note and a plane ticket through an enchanted 
                        mirror. When Esther uses that ticket, she soon meets more people who know about magic and is forced to decide whom she can trust as 
                        she tries to discover why someone wants her dead. Törzs’ simple magic system of books is straightforward, with clear rules set out for 
                        readers early on, leaving her plenty of space to explore how an obsession with power can twist people so deeply that they betray the 
                        ones they love. Esther and Joanna’s complicated but loving relationship is wonderfully rendered, and Törzs pulls off such an expert 
                        series of twists that readers would be advised to cancel their plans until they get to the end.
