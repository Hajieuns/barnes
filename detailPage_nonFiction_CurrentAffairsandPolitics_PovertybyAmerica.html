                <p>
                    Nearly forty million in the wealthiest democracy on the planet "live" at or below the 
                    poverty line, crushed by it. Poverty, By America answers why that is. We are all 
                    culpable, witting and unwitting. How did we get here, how do we collectively 
                    perpetuate poverty’s reach and how might we be able to undo this suffering? Fierce, 
                    unflinching, and crytsal clear, Matthew Desmond lays down a line in the sand and 
                    yet imagines that with some hard work, there is a path to a more accountable, 
                    equitable, compassionate nation.

                    In this landmark book, acclaimed sociologist Matthew Desmond draws on history, 
                    research, and original reporting to show how affluent Americans knowingly and 
                    unknowingly keep poor people poor. Those of us who are financially secure exploit 
                    the poor, driving down their wages while forcing them to overpay for housing and 
                    access to cash and credit. We prioritize the subsidization of our wealth over the 
                    alleviation of poverty, designing a welfare state that gives the most to those who 
                    need the least. And we stockpile opportunity in exclusive communities, creating 
                    zones of concentrated riches alongside those of concentrated despair. Some lives are 
                    made small so that others may grow.         
                </p>
                <p>
                    Elegantly written and fiercely argued, this compassionate book gives us new ways of 
                    thinking about a morally urgent problem. It also helps us imagine solutions. 
                    Desmond builds a startlingly original and ambitious case for ending poverty. He 
                    calls on us all to become poverty abolitionists, engaged in a politics of collective 
                    belonging to usher in a new age of shared prosperity and, at last, true freedom.

                    Pulitzer winner Desmond follows up Evicted with a powerful inquiry into why the U.S. is “the richest country on earth, with more poverty 
                    than any other advanced democracy.” Noting that 38 million Americans cannot afford basic necessities, Desmond argues that poverty 
                    persists because others benefit from it: workers are paid non-living wages and unions are discouraged in order to boost the pay of 
                    corporate executives; poor consumers are overcharged for rental housing and financial services so that landlords and banks can 
                    prosper; and affluent families benefit from tax breaks, student loans, and other forms of federal aid while welfare programs are 
                    publicly belittled and made difficult to access. Poverty is further entrenched by the underfunding of education, mass transit, and 
                    healthcare, Desmond argues, creating a world of private opulence and public squalor. His solutions include eliminating the 
                    residential segregation that blocks poor families from well-funded public services and employment and housing opportunities. 
                    More broadly, he calls for better-off Americans to acknowledge their complicity in perpetuating poverty and to pressure the 
                    government to undertake “an aggressive, uncompromising antipoverty agenda.” Though the path to achieving these reforms
                     isn’t always clear, Desmond enriches his detailed and trenchant analysis with poignant reflections on America’s “unblushing
                     inequality” and the “anomie of wealth.” It’s a gut-wrenching call for change. Agent: Katherine Flynn, Kneerim & Williams. (Mar.)

                        Pulitzer Prize—winning sociologist Desmond (Evicted) argues that poverty exists in the United States because wealthy people benefit from it. 
                        While the United States ranks among the richest countries in the world, it has the largest amount of poverty; the author expects that to expand. 
                        Presently, every one in three Americans work in low-paying jobs, one in eight live in severe poverty, and the wealth gap between Black and white 
                        families remains large. For example, in the average white family, the head of household with a high school diploma is better paid than the head
                         of a Black household with a college degree. The author also points to when most white women did not have to work outside their home; whereas 
                        Black women, to survive, had to work any job available. The author suggests solutions by advocating for what he calls "poverty abolitionists," 
                        people he hopes will insist on collective bargaining and producing true economic rewards for workers. He also urges the government to end hunger 
                        and create laws that ensure all Americans make a livable wage. VERDICT This book will likely interest scholars. Add it to social and behavioral
                         sciences collections.—Claude Ury

                        “America’s poverty is not for lack of resources,” writes Desmond. “We lack something else.” That something else is compassion, in part, but it’s 
                        also the lack of a social system that insists that everyone pull their weight—and that includes the corporations and wealthy individuals who, the IRS 
                        estimates, get away without paying upward of $1 trillion per year. Desmond, who grew up in modest circumstances and suffered poverty in young 
                        adulthood, points to the deleterious effects of being poor—among countless others, the precarity of health care and housing (with no meaningful 
                        controls on rent), lack of transportation, the constant threat of losing one’s job due to illness, and the need to care for dependent children. It does
                         not help, Desmond adds, that so few working people are represented by unions or that Black Americans, even those who have followed the 
                        “three rules” (graduate from high school, get a full-time job, wait until marriage to have children), are far likelier to be poor than their White 
                        compatriots. Furthermore, so many full-time jobs are being recast as contracted, fire-at-will gigs, “not a break from the norm as much as an
                         extension of it, a continuation of corporations finding new ways to limit their obligations to workers.” By Desmond’s reckoning, besides 
                        amending these conditions, it would not take a miracle to eliminate poverty: about $177 billion, which would help end hunger and homelessness 
                        and “make immense headway in driving down the many agonizing correlates of poverty, like violence, sickness, and despair.” These are matters 
                        requiring systemic reform, which will in turn require Americans to elect officials who will enact that reform. And all of us, the author urges, must 
                        become “poverty abolitionists…refusing to live as unwitting enemies of the poor.” Fortune 500 CEOs won’t like Desmond’s message for 
                        rewriting the social contract—which is precisely the point.

                        Desmond’s new book is short, smart, and thrilling. The thrill comes from the sheer boldness of Desmond’s argument and his carefully modulated

                        in Desmond’s account of how government and social policy act in ways commensurate with his class-war thesis. Its texture is provided by effective

                        Dion Graham is a master of nonfiction narration. He knows exactly when to pause, sets off quotations flawlessly, and brings exquisite emotion 
                        to the text. Here, Graham varies his pacing to complement the flow of Matthew Desmond's writing, whether he's describing the depth of 
                        American poverty, the history of why poverty exists in such a wealthy country, or the heartrending examples of poverty's effects on real people. 
                        Desmond debunks old tropes surrounding poverty. For example, he says the poor are not lazy and idle; they often work several jobs to stay 
                        afloat. He urges listeners to become poverty abolitionists in order to end this national disgrace. As in their previous pairing (EVICTED, 2016), 
                        Graham performs with energy and intensity, matching Desmond's outrage. S.G. Winner of AudioFile Earphones Award © AudioFile 2023,
