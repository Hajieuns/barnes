                    Fairy Tale. Fantasy, horror and the universal appeal of good vs. evil abound.

                    Charlie Reade looks like a regular high school kid, great at baseball and football, a 
                    decent student. But he carries a heavy load. His mom was killed in a hit-and-run 
                    accident when he was seven, and grief drove his dad to drink. Charlie learned how 
                    to take care of himself—and his dad. When Charlie is seventeen, he meets a dog 
                    named Radar and her aging master, Howard Bowditch, a recluse in a big house at 
                    the top of a big hill, with a locked shed in the backyard. Sometimes strange sounds 
                    emerge from that shed.     
                </p>
                <p>
                    Charlie starts doing jobs for Mr. Bowditch and loses his heart to Radar. Then, when 
                    Bowditch dies, he leaves Charlie a cassette tape telling a story no one would believe. 
                    What Bowditch knows, and has kept secret all his long life, is that inside the shed is 
                    a portal to another world.

                    Bestseller King (Billy Summers) underwhelms in an overlong fantasy most likely to appeal to his YA fans. In 2003, seven-year-old Charlie 
                    Reade’s mother dies in an accident, sending his father into an alcoholic tailspin. Ten years later, a chance event changes Charlie’s life 
                    dramatically; while passing by a neighbor’s home, he hears frantic barking, and a feeble cry for help. He discovers elderly Howard 
                    Bowditch badly injured from a fall and calls 911, earning him Bowditch’s gratitude and a reputation as a hero. Charlie becomes the 
                    caretaker for both the dog, Radar, whom he grows to love, and Bowditch, who gradually reveals his secrets, including the source of 
                    the gold pellets he keeps in his safe: the mysterious shed on his property contains a portal to another world, one teeming with evil 
                    that wants to escape. Once the action shifts there, the plot becomes derivative, retreading standard portal fantasy tropes and the 
                    familiar struggle between good and evil. Illustrations at the start of each chapter, headed with descriptions of what they include, 
                    further convey a juvenile feel. This attempt at creating a sense of wonder and magic falls short. (Sept.)

                        “I read (in one long, long sitting) Stephen King's fabulous Fairy Tale and it was just such a trip! A trip to a magical, terrifying land 
                        where wonders and horrors are one. But also a trip back home- to that prose that lulled me into nightmares in my teens. The voice 
                        of the King.” —Guillermo del Toro

                        “Stephen King has all the daring, enchantment and even romance of a classic bedtime story, but King's signature unsettling style will 
                        keep you sitting up straight and wide-eyed rather than drifting off to dreamland.” —Vanity Fair

                        "High-schooler Charlie Reade, son of a widowed recovering alcoholic, is walking by the town’s rundown “psycho house" when he hears a 
                        distressed barking. Entering the backyard, Charlie finds the house's owner, Mr. Bowditch, laying on the ground—with a broken leg—guarded by 
                        his faithful old dog, Radar. Charlie becomes caretaker for Mr. Bowditch and forms a strong bond with ailing Radar. Soon Charlie finds a 
                        mysterious shed in the backyard that serves an entrance to a different world where it may be possible to reverse the dog's aging. Numrich’s 
                        narration of Charlie’s quest is everything a reader appreciates. He uses unique voices for all of the characters, both human and inhuman, 
                        drawing readers completely into the parallel universe, and sounds convincing as a teenager. The narration undoubtedly drives the story and will 
                        keep listeners entranced. This gateway fantasy is ideal for anyone looking for a world-building journey similar to Frodo’s quest in The Hobbit. 
                        Charlie is highly likable and his devotion to Radar only adds to the appeal. Fans of all things Stephen King may also enjoy the parallels between 
                        his narration of Bowditch’s recorded messages to Charlie and his cameos in the film adaptations of his novels."

                        King's (Billy Summers) latest overlong offering is really two books in one. The first part concerns 17-year-old Charlie Reade, who is traumatized 
                        by his mother's early death and his father's subsequent alcoholism. One day Charlie hears a dog barking frantically while walking past the nearby 
                        "Psycho House." There he finds injured, crabby old Mr. Bowditch. Charlie decides to help Mr. Bowditch by cleaning his house, caring for his aged 
                        dog, Radar, and providing outpatient care. Turns out that Mr. Bowditch has an inexplicable amount of gold, and there's some weird stuff going on 
                        out in the locked shed. Eventually Charlie discovers a portal to Empis, an enchanting realm that holds many dangers. Charlie's journey though Empis 
                        abounds in expected fairy-tale tropes and references. Narrator Seth Numerick does a super job giving voice to the many characters. Bowditch sure 
                        sounds cranky; Charlie sounds wise beyond his years; and the evil king is horrifying. As always, the book could have benefited from editing, as the story 
                        sometimes drags. Even so, Numerick maintains interest through excellent pacing, well-placed humor, and a convincing portrayal of fear and shame. 
                        VERDICT Patrons will be clamoring for this one. Public libraries should purchase multiple copies.—B. Allison Gray

                        Seth Numrich’s narration of 17-year-old Charlie Reade’s story is moving and frightening in equal measure. Charlie befriends a reclusive curmudgeon, 
                        Howard Bowditch, and his aging dog, and inherits Howard’s house and dog when he dies. Howard also leaves Charlie a cassette recording—voiced 
                        remarkably by Stephen King. On it, Howard recounts a story within the story, involving a locked shed, a portal to a dying world, and Charlie’s part in 
                        a plan for salvation. Numrich creates a distinctive voice for each character, complete with growls and guttural snarls for evildoers. He even makes a 
                        hum sound threatening. Listeners will be drawn into this audiobook by the intimate tone of Numrich’s narration, which is like hearing Charlie himself.

                        Narnia on the Penobscot: a grand, and naturally strange, entertainment from the ever prolific King.     
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        What’s a person to do when sheltering from Covid? In King’s case, write something to entertain himself while reflecting on what was going on in the 
                        world outside—ravaged cities, contentious politics, uncertainty. King’s yarn begins in a world that’s recognizably ours, and with a familiar trope: A young 
                        woman, out to buy fried chicken, is mashed by a runaway plumber’s van, sending her husband into an alcoholic tailspin and her son into a preadolescent 
                        funk, driven “bugfuck” by a father who “was always trying to apologize.” The son makes good by rescuing an elderly neighbor who’s fallen off a ladder, 
                        though he protests that the man’s equally elderly German shepherd, Radar, was the true hero. Whatever the case, Mr. Bowditch has an improbable trove of 
                        gold in his Bates Motel of a home, and its origin seems to lie in a shed behind the house, one that Mr. Bowditch warns the boy away from: “ ‘Don’t go in 
                        there,’ he said. ‘You may in time, but for now don’t even think of it.’ ” It’s not Pennywise who awaits in the underworld behind the shed door, but there’s 
                        plenty that’s weird and unexpected, including a woman, Dora, whose “skin was slate gray and her face was cruelly deformed,” and a whole bunch of people
                        —well, sort of people, anyway—who’d like nothing better than to bring their special brand of evil up to our world’s surface. King’s young protagonist, 
                        Charlie Reade, is resourceful beyond his years, but it helps that the old dog gains some of its youthful vigor in the depths below. King delivers a more or 
                        less traditional fable that includes a knowing nod: “I think I know what you want,” Charlie tells the reader, "and now you have it”—namely, a happy 
                        ending but with a suitably sardonic wink.

                        A tale that’s at once familiar and full of odd and unexpected twists—vintage King, in other words.
