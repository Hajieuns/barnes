                <span>
                    Stephen Covey must be rightfully proud of his son Sean, who absorbed his father’s lessons well. Those who wish to avoid the temptations and devastation 
                    of drugs, including alcohol, would be wise to implement The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens. Written for teenagers, this book is an indispensable tool, 
                    helping young people make the right choices, while growing up in the chaos of today. I wish there had been a book like this for those of us who grew up in
                     the sixties.

                        I highly recommend the simple, straight forward advice provided in The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens book to teenagers, young adults, and
                        their parents. You’ll hear new perspectives on how to improve your relationships and leadership skills that will positively impact your life, resulting 
                       in greater happiness…. And more than that—you will be able to do it and be successful at anything you choose to do. I have personally read it and 
                       practiced the timeless principles with my daughters.

                        The best way to ‘make it happen’ in your life is to make the right choices as a teen. The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens lets teens see 
                        themselves as the principal force in their lives, regardless of their background or current walk of life.

                        Today’s teens are the future leaders of our families, communities, and nation. The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens teaches them the 
                        value of hard work, setting and achieving goals, and taking responsibility and initiative, all of which are characteristics of effective leaders.

                        Unlike my book on the 7 Habits, this book, by my son Sean, speaks directly to teens in an entertaining and visually appealing style (and Sean,
                        I never thought you listened to a word I said). As prejudiced as this may sound, this is a remarkable book, a must-read!

                        I have long been a fan of Stephen Covey and his book, The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. In fact, I liked his principles so much 
                        that we teach it to our players in the off-season as leadership principles. When I saw Sean’s book on The 7 Habits of Highly Effective 
                        Teens, I was excited to have another weapon to take our players and culture to a higher level. Whether you are a teen or not, you should read this book!

                        I would highly recommend Sean Covey’s book The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens because it teaches whoever reads it how to 
                        set goals, get organized, prioritize, make good decisions, and most of all, to help build good character. Take it from me — they are
                         all the things that will help them achieve success in their lives. Sean does a great job with the book.
