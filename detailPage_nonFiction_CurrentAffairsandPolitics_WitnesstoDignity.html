                <h3>Notes From Your Bookseller</h3>
                <p>
                    A beautiful inside look at a very public and devout couple from their long-time 
                    pastor. This is a great read for anyone interested in faith, family, leadership, and a 
                    front row at history.        
                </p>
                <p class="bold">
                    This is the untold, intimate, and eye-witness account of the character, integrity, 
                    service, faith, and dignity of former President George H.W. Bush and first lady 
                    Barbara Bush by their priest, pastor, and friend.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    George and Barbara Bush belonged to and were active members of a Houston 
                    church for more than 50 years. The rector of that church, Reverend Russell Jones 
                    Levenson, Jr., believes he was invited into private moments with these public 
                    individuals so he could serve as a witness: a witness to observe, and a witness to tell.         
                </p>
                <p>
                    With never-before shared correspondence, experiences, and personal stories, 
                    Levenson offers new insight into the Bushes’ wit and wisdom; their commitment to 
                    family and friends; their tireless desire to bless the lives of others; and their steadfast 
                    loyalty to their church, their faith, and their God. Before embarking on writing this 
                    book on faith, Levenson sought and received the blessing of all the Bush children, 
                    including the 43rd president.              
                </p>
                <p>
                    Readers will laugh, cry, and be inspired as Levenson ponders how and why he was 
                    put in this unique pastoral position, asking questions like, “What on earth was I 
                    doing reading the sports section of the paper with the forty-first president, his 
                    cabinet member Brent Scowcroft, and a Chinese official on a breezy morning at 
                    Walker’s Point in Kennebunkport, Maine?”               
                </p>
                <p>
                    Levenson writes with emotion about being with President Bush and Barbara Bush as 
                    they each took their last breaths on this earth. He then describes in full detail the 
                    surreal experience of planning a state funeral and giving a eulogy with other 
                    presidents in the front row.                
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is book is for readers who yearn for our public officials to serve with faith and 
                    integrity like the Bushes. But above all else, this book shows how powerful it is when 
                    world leaders are humbled before the power that rests above all powers.            
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Reverend Levenson was a dear friend and spiritual mentor to both my beloved 
                    grandparents. His stories of friendship will fill you with hope and inspire grace.”

                    "For George and Barbara Bush, action spoke louder than words. And so, they preferred doing the Lord’s work more than talking 
                    about the Lord’s work. That quality was an integral part of the couple’s shared goal to 'make kinder the face of the nation and 
                    gentler the face of the world.' Russ Levenson has eloquently captured the essence and dignity of these two beautiful human beings
                     who remain role models of character, decency, and integrity."

                    "Russ Levenson’s Witness to Dignity is a beautiful tribute to God and the faith of George H. W. and Barbara Bush that sustained them
                    during their lives. Through their abiding love for one another, they inspired everyone in their orbit to strive for a life of purpose that
                    would lead to success, while also keeping us humble, service-oriented, and joyous. They shared so much of themselves with the world,
                    and now Witness to Dignity helps us better understand how to conduct ourselves in the same gracious ways. This book is one to keep
                    handy through the good and bad times—a lovely reminder of a couple so admired for how they lived life to the fullest and trusted in 
                   God to show them the way."—Dana Perino, White House Press Secretary to President George W. Bush and a Fox News anchor and co-host
                   "Much has been written about the 41st President and First Lady. What makes this book unique and profoundly moving is Levenson’s 
                   unapologetically personal account, as if we have been invited to sit at the family table and catch a glimpse of their deep love and abiding faith."

                   of President Bush as a Christian. It is a fascinating read and an important contribution to the literature of our 41st president."

                     and thereby becoming exemplars for us all. Russ Levenson witnessed their final decades: in this warm and personal volume, he shares the

                    of grace, honor, determination, and doing what is best for their country. Russ has a unique perspective to this wonderful and respected 
                    couple who served our country for decades. This book captures the real personalities of the Bushes and reveals some untold vignettes 
                    which makes this book a must read.”—The Honorable Dan Quayle, 44th Vice President of the United States

                    account of the last years in the lives of First Lady Barbara and President George Bush, to the story of their passing, the heft and scale
                     of his account of their character and convictions starts to show. As this book tells it, their generous living and dying, the courage, 
                    strength, hope, and lightness of heart they brought to them, had church and faith at their core. When all that comes together at the 
                    honoring of their passing, in scripture, hymns, and preaching, given structure by the beauty and wise order of service of the Book of

                    "Take it from a Catholic, this gifted Episcopalian Reverend knows how to inspire, and in reflecting on the lives of George and Barbara 
                    Bush, he knows what 'inspiring' is as well. It’s not about who you are or what religion you are or whether you subscribe to any religion
                     at all, it’s about how you conduct your life. It’s not what you 'show off' to the world but what you quietly 'show' the world. There is
                     a great humility and dignity to the entire Bush family, and I clearly see where it starts, and where it remains. Such dignity is rare. 
                    Sharing it with someone like my friend, the Reverend Russ Levenson, is rarer still. That’s what makes this book so compelling. We get 
                    to see a side of an incredible family few really know from the vantage point of a wonderful man of God whose uplifting words we all 
                    need to hear. It says a lot about a former President and his wife. I think it says a lot as well about the person they let enter that world

                   other gardens throughout the Kennebunkport community when Reverend Russell Levenson’s wonderful new book arrived. To the many
                    who loved Barbara and her devoted husband, President George HW Bush, the flower serves as an annual reminder of their years of 
                   leadership, when Walker’s Point was known as the 'Summer White House.' More importantly, it comes as a touching reminder of their 
                   years of friendship, when townspeople looked forward to their return to this little village by the sea that they loved so dearly.
                    Nowhere can this part of the Bushes’ lives be better explored than in Witness to Dignity. As the rector of St. Martin’s Episcopal 
                   Church in Houston, where they were active members for over 50 years, Russ Levenson developed a lasting and intimate friendship 
                   with President Bush and Barbara. He was with them when their lives were active and full, and with them as they were drawing their 
                   final breath. He saw them in good times and bad, and witnessed a depth of character and a faith in their God that was unquestioned 
                   and unchanging, one that brought a constant light to their lives, and through them to the lives of countless others. His stories are 
                   both insightful and funny. It’s a book to read, enjoy, and learn from. And like the poppies that reveal their beauty in early summer,
                    it’s a book that will reveal to us the beauty of President George HW and Barbara Bush, the importance of faith, and the value of friendships."

                    and his First Lady. The spotlight has been cast many times on anyone running for high political office. There are very few secrets 
                   that have not been shared with the world. Yet this is a book that truly invites us into a world that a secular press is not really interested in.

                    up the book simply because it is about George H.W. and Barbara Bush; and countless readers will put down the book having learned
