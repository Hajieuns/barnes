                <p>
                    Small Mercies is Dennis Lehane’s latest novel since 2017’s Since We Fell. As with 
                    the best of Lehane’s work, a thriller is perfectly blended with issues of social 
                    injustice. Dennis Lehane uses the eyes of a detective and the ears of a newspaper 
                    reporter on the neighborhood beat, wrapping them in beautiful words that cut to 
                    the heart of humanity.

                    Instant New York Times Bestseller
                    “Small Mercies is thought provoking, engaging, enraging, and can’t-put-it-down 
                    entertainment.” — Stephen King

                    The acclaimed New York Times bestselling writer returns with a masterpiece to rival 
                    Mystic River—an all-consuming tale of revenge, family love, festering hate, and 
                    insidious power, set against one of the most tumultuous episodes in Boston’s history.

                <p>
                    In the summer of 1974 a heatwave blankets Boston and Mary Pat Fennessy is trying 
                    to stay one step ahead of the bill collectors. Mary Pat has lived her entire life in the 
                    housing projects of “Southie,” the Irish American enclave that stubbornly adheres to 
                    old tradition and stands proudly apart.        
                </p>
                <p>
                    One night Mary Pat’s teenage daughter Jules stays out late and doesn’t come home. 
                    That same evening, a young Black man is found dead, struck by a subway train 
                    under mysterious circumstances.              
                </p>
                <p>
                    The two events seem unconnected. But Mary Pat, propelled by a desperate search for 
                    her missing daughter, begins turning over stones best left untouched—asking 
                    questions that bother Marty Butler, chieftain of the Irish mob, and the men who 
                    work for him, men who don’t take kindly to any threat to their business.           
                </p>
                <p>
                    Set against the hot, tumultuous months when the city’s desegregation of its public 
                    schools exploded in violence, Small Mercies is a superb thriller, a brutal depiction of 
                    criminality and power, and an unflinching portrait of the dark heart of American 
                    racism. It is a mesmerizing and wrenching work that only Dennis Lehane could write.

                    Set during the summer of 1974, this superior crime drama from bestseller Lehane (Since We Fell) explores deep-rooted racism 
                    in South Boston. While the community primes for a series of rallies organized by mob boss Marty Butler against school desegregation, 
                    42-year-old single mother Mary Pat Fennessy is preoccupied with the disappearance of her rebellious, 17-year-old daughter, Jules. 
                    Though Jules’s friends claim she started walking home around midnight, mistrust and animosity toward Jules’s doltish boyfriend and 
                    a drug dealer Mary Pat holds responsible for her late son’s overdose bring out a mother’s frustration and rage. Her ensuing acts attract 
                    the interest of two detectives who are investigating the mysterious death of a Black man at a nearby subway station. The unwanted 
                    attention Mary Pat draws to the neighborhood threatens Butler’s business dealings, making him and his close-knit crew keen to put an 
                    end to her search. That Mary Pat is good with a pistol and capable of beating up young guys may stretch credulity, especially as there’s 
                    no mention of guns and fighting in her past, but the action builds to a gloriously tense and discomforting finale. Readers will be left 
                    feeling battered and scarred. Agent: Ann Rittenberg, Ann Rittenberg Literary. (Apr.)

                        impossible to ignore. Thought-provoking and heart-thumping, it's a resonant, unflinching story written by a novelist who is simply one of the best

                        asks some of the only questions that matter: 'What’s gonna change? When’s it gonna change? Where’s it gonna change? How’s it gonna change?'

                        In the hot summer of 1974, anti-busing violence and racism erupt in Boston. The same night a young Black man named Auggie Williamson dies in 
                        the subway, Mary Pat Fennessey's 17-year-old daughter, Jules, disappears. When she can't get information from the young people with Jules that
                        night, Mary Pat turns to the men who offer protection in the neighborhood, Marty Butler's Irish crew. Mary Pat already lost one child to drugs 
                        and the streets, and she is scared she might have lost another one. When she can't get answers as a grieving mother, all of her fear turns to learning 
                        the truth. Why was Jules near the subway where Auggie Williamson died? Where is her daughter? Homicide officer Bobby Coyne sees violence and 
                        death in Boston every day, and he's investigating the Williamson case. But he can only watch in awe as Mary Pat, a tough Southie broad who was 
                        born to fight, turns all of her maternal rage and street instincts into her own investigation. Mary Pat might well burn down the neighborhood to 
                        discover what happened to her daughter. VERDICT After almost six years since his last novel, Since We Fell, Lehane's (Mystic River; Shutter Island) 
                        latest is inspired by a childhood experience when his family was caught up in the violence of the anti-busing riots. Pair this powerful, unforgettable 
                        story with S.A. Cosby's Razorblade Tears, another remarkable novel about racism, violence, and parental vengeance.—Lesa Holstine

                        A master of literary crime fiction, Lehane revisits the Boston of almost a half-century ago, when, in 1974, court-ordered school busing incites protest 
                        throughout the White neighborhoods of a very segregated city. As a working-class White woman trying to keep one step ahead of the bill collector, 
                        Mary Pat Fennessy has a close but tense relationship with her teenage daughter, Jules, who seems to be keeping secrets from her mother. One night 
                        Jules doesn’t come home, and Mary Pat is frantic. The next day at Meadow Lane Manor, the old folks’ home where she works as an aide, she learns 
                        that the son of Dreamy Williamson, one of her few Black co-workers, died in a mysterious subway incident that night. Mary Pat doesn’t know 
                        Dreamy well but likes her well enough. It seems that both of them have lost children now, but they respond differently, experience different levels of 
                        support from their communities, and come to learn that these seemingly separate losses—a death and a disappearance—have a connection that neither 
                        could have anticipated. The novel focuses on Mary Pat, illuminates her from within as a loving mother and basically a decent person who nonetheless 
                        shares the tribal prejudices of her Irish neighborhood toward people whom they feel are encroaching on their turf. It’s a hot summer, tensions are 
                        escalating, and threats of violence are at fever pitch. As Mary Pat keeps trying to find out what happened to Jules and why—wherever the truth may 
                        lead her—she discovers how much she has to learn about her daughter, the neighborhood, and the crime outfit whose power and authority have long 
                        gone unchallenged. She risks everything to discover the truth.

                        Robin Miles shines in this compelling story about family, culture, and justice. The story is set in Boston against the backdrop of the 1974 protests 
                        against public school integration. Mary Pat Fennessy has lived in the Southie housing projects all her life. One summer night, her daughter Jules 
                        doesn't come home, and a young Black man is killed. As Mary Pat asks questions--and closes in on what happened--she begins to rethink everything 
                        she's been told about what separates us and what brings us together. Miles captures the dialect of the community, as well as Mary Pat's desperation 
                        and determination. A word of caution: The language and racial slurs used match the historical context of the story but can be difficult to listen to.
