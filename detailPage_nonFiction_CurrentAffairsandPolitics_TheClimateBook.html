                    Determined protester, author, now dominant world voice for environmental redress, 
                    Greta Thunberg provides us with a resource primer for change, bringing together, 
                    with her own commentary throughout, a remarkable congress of over 100 climate 
                    experts — scientists, philosophers, economists, and historians — true testament to 
                    her belief that knowledge is indeed powerful.

                    We still have time to change the world. From climate activist Greta Thunberg, 
                    comes the essential handbook for making it happen.

                    You might think it's an impossible task: secure a safe future for life on Earth, at a 
                    scale and speed never seen, against all the odds. There is hope—but only if we listen 
                    to the science before it's too late.       
                </p>
                <p>
                    In The Climate Book, Greta Thunberg has gathered the wisdom of over one hundred 
                    experts—geophysicists, oceanographers and meteorologists; engineers, economists 
                    and mathematicians; historians, philosophers and Indigenous leaders—to equip us 
                    all with the knowledge we need to combat climate disaster. Throughout, illuminating 
                    and often shocking grayscale charts, graphs, diagrams, photographs, and 
                    illustrations underscore their research and their arguments. Alongside them, she 
                    shares her own stories of demonstrating and uncovering greenwashing around the 
                    world, revealing how much we have been kept in the dark. This is one of our biggest 
                    challenges, she shows, but also our greatest source of hope. Once we are given the 
                    full picture, how can we not act? And if a schoolchild's strike could ignite a global 
                    protest, what could we do collectively if we tried?             
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are alive at the most decisive time in the history of humanity. Together, we can 
                    do the seemingly impossible. But it has to be us, and it has to be now.

                <p>
                    <strong>Greta Thunberg</strong> was born in 2003. In August 2018, she started a school strike for 
                    the climate outside the Swedish Parliament that has since spread all over the world. 
                    She is an activist in Fridays for Future and has spoken at climate rallies across the 
                    globe, as well as at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the US Congress, and the 
                    United Nations.

                    Humanity must decarbonize or die, according to this impassioned anthology of writings on climate change. Climate activist Thunberg (No One 
                    Is Too Small to Make a Difference) gathers essays from scientists, journalists, and activists, starting with lucid and accessible explanations of the 
                    science of global warming and its possible effects. Other pieces include upbeat assessments of solar and wind energy by eco-pundit Bill McKibben 
                    and recommendations for vegetarianism and shifting from cars to bicycles and mass transit. Economists Lucas Chancel and Thomas Piketty call 
                    for redistributive taxes on carbon, while journalist Naomi Klein insists that “as we get clean, we must begin to redress the founding crimes of our 
                    nations. Land theft. Genocide. Slavery. Imperialism.” Thunberg’s own essays scold politicians for foot-dragging on decarbonization (“They read 
                    stock-market analysis to the waves of the ocean, like fools”) and call for “immediate, drastic, annual emission reductions on a scale unlike 
                    anything the world has ever seen.” While many authors sound an apocalyptic note, their doomsaying often relies on models with myriad 
                    variables, as when oceanographer Stefan Rahmstorf notes that “we have enough ice on Earth to raise sea levels by 65 metres,” a process 
                    that may unfold “over centuries and millennia to come.” Still, this is a comprehensive and articulate shock to the system. Illus. (Feb.)

                        In this galvanizing follow-up to No One Is Too Small To Make a Difference, Thunberg presents an urgent collection of writing by leaders in 
                        the fields of science, engineering, history, philosophy, and activism. The brilliant and alarming narrative tells it like it is: Though politicians, 
                        fossil fuel stakeholders, and other relevant entities have known for decades that a warming climate will have devastating results for Earth, 
                        most have done little about it. “It is my genuine belief,” writes Thunberg, “that the only way we will be able to avoid the worst 
                        consequences of this emerging existential crisis is if we create a critical mass of people who demand the changes required.” 
                        Throughout the book, the contributors—among other luminaries, Elizabeth Kolbert, Michael Oppenheimer, Naomi Oreskes, 
                        Mike Berners-Lee, Robin Wall Kimmerer, and Margaret Atwood—clearly explain the tipping points that have already occurred, 
                        permanently altering the oceans, forests, fauna, and atmosphere and the fact that a concerted, global effort is required to effect positive
                         change. The contributors also lay bare the fact that irresponsible, even pernicious, action by those who pushed for fossil fuel use but 
                        “greenwashed” information about the effects of greenhouse gas emissions has resulted in prolonged inertia, allowing the problem to 
                        get much worse. Yet most of the contributors remain optimistic that, with enough public outrage and demands for change, a solution
                         is possible—only if we act immediately. In the last part of this book, Thunberg provides a guide to what needs to be done and how
                         every single person on the planet can play a role. “We have the unfathomably great opportunity to be alive at the most decisive 
                        time in the history of humanity….Together, we can do the seemingly impossible. But make no mistake—no one else is going to 
                        do it for us.” The book includes numerous illustrative graphs and charts.

                        The young Swedish climate activist and symbol of the fight against global warming, Greta Thunberg, reads English surprisingly 
                        well at an effective pace. Her voice rings with passion, palpable emotion, and earnest commitment. She is joined by a talented 
                        trio of English narrators who bring skill and understanding to these often frightening essays. Climate experts and other scientists 
                        ranging from entomologists to hydrologists sound the alarm about the shocking state of our warming planet. The audiobook 
                        describes how we’ve arrived at this state, calls out the perpetrators—the media, politicos, corporate leaders—prescribes what 
                        governments on all levels must do, and asks everyone to do their part. This anthology of experts, artists, and, especially, the 
                        young woman influencing a generation is a clarion call. A.D.M. Winner of AudioFile Earphones Award © AudioFile 2023,
