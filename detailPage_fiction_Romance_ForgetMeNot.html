                    Are you worried about spoiler alerts? With a title inspired by a popular bridal 
                    flower and a love interest named “Bloom”, we think you know where this is going. 
                    M’wah!

                    A wedding planner and her grumpy ex must work together to plan a celebrity event 
                    in this deliciously spicy and funny novel from Ali Hazelwood's "favorite writer."     
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ama Torres is an optimistic wedding planner who doesn’t believe in marriage. But 
                    weddings? They’re amazing. Elliot Bloom is a brooding florist who hates owning a 
                    flower shop…until a certain bright-eyed, donut-loving workaholic shows up at his 
                    door.
                           
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once upon a time, they collaborated on events by day, and by night, Ama traced 
                    the intricate flower tattoos etched along his body. Then Ama shattered his heart 
                    and never spoke to Elliot again.          
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now they’re working on an event that could make or break both of their careers—
                    except neither of them has gotten over what happened two years ago. Things are 
                    not helped by the two brides, who see the obvious chemistry between Ama and 
                    Elliot and are determined to set them up, not knowing their complicated history. 
                    But as the wedding takes on a life of its own, Ama and Elliot are about to discover 
                    that some things can survive a complete catastrophe . . .           
                </p>
                <p>
                    Smart and hilarious, Forget Me Not is about two people giving themselves—and 
                    love!—a second chance.

                    A commitment-phobic wedding planner stars in Soto’s tender but bumpy debut. Plucky and ambitious Ama Torres will do whatever it takes to provide 
                    the perfect party for her clients, but after witnessing her mother marry and divorce 16 times, she no longer believes in lasting relationships for herself. 
                    When a big-time influencer couple choose her to plan their wedding, Ama is thrilled about the exposure—until she discovers that they’ve hired her former 
                    fling Elliot Bloom as their florist. The ensuing second chance romance between Ama and Elliot offers beguiling moments of both tension and tenderness, 
                    but Soto over-relies on some unconvincing cursing to convey their chemistry, especially in the many steamy scenes (“ ‘Fuck,’ she moans against me... 
                    ‘Oh fuck!’ ”). Hiccups with the nuptials add a whirlwind of drama to proceedings, but the secondary characters go frustratingly underdeveloped and, 
                    outside of the romance plot, the dialogue becomes superficial. Still, fans of the grumpy/sunshine trope will swoon over surly Elliot, who prefers plants to 
                    people but whose good heart shines through his crankiness, and Ama proves easy to root for as she learns to open her heart. It’s not perfect, but Soto shows 
                    promise. Agent: Gaia Banks, Sheil Land Assoc. (July)

                        DEBUT A cheerful wedding planner who doesn't believe in commitment gets a second chance at love with a grumpy florist in Soto's debut. Ama Torres 
                        started designing weddings for her oft-married mother when she was still a teenager; now she owns her own wedding planning and design business. When 
                        celebrity influencer Hazel Renee chooses Ama to run her wedding, she is excited to take her business to the next level of success, but this opportunity also 
                        forces her into close proximity with a man she never expected to see again. Elliot Bloom is a reclusive, tattooed florist who works magic with his floral designs 
                        and who once had incredible personal and professional chemistry with Ama. As the wedding draws closer and the two become entangled once more, Ama and 
                        Elliot must decide whether to open their hearts to each other again. Together they explore the boundaries between the professional and personal, and the 
                        differences between love, commitment, and marriage. VERDICT A funny, heartfelt love letter to the author's hometown of Sacramento, that will interest 
                        readers who enjoy second-chance romance, fiery sexual chemistry, and grumpy/sunshine relationship dynamics.—Sierra Wilson

                        A wedding planner and a florist with a romantic history are forced to work together for a celebrity wedding in this sexy romance debut.

                        Despite taking great pride in her work as a wedding planner, Ama Torres has no desire to get married. After witnessing her mother’s numerous failed 
                        marriages, Ama is fine letting others say “I do” but has decided it's not for her. Elliot Bloom never thought he'd become a florist, but he begrudgingly 
                        accepts the role after his father leaves him his flower shop. When Ama is hired by an influencer with 4.2 million Instagram followers, she knows exposure on 
                        this level could skyrocket her business and lead to work with more high-profile clients. Unfortunately, the brides already have Elliot in mind as a florist, which 
                        could pose a bit of a problem. A couple of years ago, Ama and Elliot seemed like the perfect pair, mixing business with pleasure. But Elliot's proposal seemed 
                        to ruin everything, and Ama has successfully avoided speaking to him since. Neither Ama nor Elliot wants to give up such a promising gig, so they agree to 
                        work together and keep their relationship history a secret. They still possess some sparkling chemistry, though, and it doesn’t go unnoticed by the meddling 
                        brides. Ama and Elliot offer differing perspectives. The present-day story is told through Ama’s optimistic first-person point of view; Elliot narrates the earlier 
                        part of their relationship in a grumpier voice, ruminating on his relationship with Ama and where it all went wrong. The main characters are front and center 
                        here, and while the detailed descriptions of a gorgeous, over-the-top wedding will send readers’ imaginations running wild picturing couture gowns and grand 
                        floral displays, the secondary characters who orbit Ama and Elliot feel paper-thin. The interactions—and sexual tension—between Ama and Elliot are where 
                        the story shines; just exercise patience with everything else.

                        Callie Dalton and Teddy Hamilton team up for a heartwarming performance of this reluctant romance. Ama, a wedding planner, and Elliot, a florist, 
                        broke up some time ago but now have an opportunity to work together again on a celebrity wedding. Dalton portrays Ama as ambitious and thoughtful, 
                        while Hamilton's Elliot is antisocial and stubborn--yet he aspires to more in his life. These performances are robust and compelling, and the focus between 
                        the characters' rekindling romance and individual motivations is balanced. What makes this audiobook a unique romance is its slower pace and character 
                        development. The lush delivery when describing the breathtaking scenery of Sacramento is an added bonus. The narrators' appropriately opposing deliveries 
                        at the beginning eventually blend into a believable natural chemistry. G.M. © AudioFile 2023, Portland, Maine
