                        when the tabloids get hold of a photo involving an Alex-Henry altercation, 
                        U.S./British relations take a turn for the worse...

                    When his mother became President, Alex Claremont-Diaz was promptly cast as the

                    pure millennial-marketing gold for the White House. There's only one problem: 
                    Alex has a beef with the actual prince, Henry, across the pond. And when the

                <p>
                    Heads of family, state, and other handlers devise a plan for damage control: staging 
                    a truce between the two rivals. What at first begins as a fake, Instragramable 
                    friendship grows deeper, and more dangerous, than either Alex or Henry could have 
                    imagined. Soon Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret romance with a surprisingly 
                    unstuffy Henry that could derail the campaign and upend two nations and begs the 
                    question: Can love save the world after all? Where do we find the courage, and the 
                    power, to be the people we are meant to be? And how can we learn to let our true 
                    colors shine through? Casey McQuiston's Red, White & Royal Blue proves: true 
                    love isn't always diplomatic.

                    …[an] exquisite debut…McQuiston masterfully navigates two very different political realms, conjuring the quick-fire decision-making of a 
                    progressive White House and the iron-grip traditionalism of Buckingham Palace with equal skill. That would be impressive enough, but it's 
                    nothing compared to the consuming vividness of Alex and Henry. They shine as individuals…and when they fall in love, the intensity of their 
                    infatuation, youthful but not immature, is intoxicating…McQuiston manages to make her characters believably, truly flawed while still utterly 
                    lovable…It's hard to watch [Alex] fall in love with Henry without falling in love a bit yourself—with them, and with this brilliant, wonderful book.

                        McQuiston’s outstanding debut pivots on an inspired rom-com premise: What if Alex Claremont-Diaz, the half-Mexican son of the first female 
                        president of the United States, fell in love with Prince Henry, England’s heir? The two heartthrobs are arch-nemeses at first. After a scandalous 
                        mishap at a wedding, however, they are required to pretend to be best friends lest their enmity spark an international incident. Not surprisingly, 
                        their hate turns into a bromance. When Henry kisses Alex, the First Son goes into a mild gay panic, but their snide texts soon become gushy emails 
                        ending with romantic quotes. The scions also contrive ways of being together at Wimbledon, in Texas, and at a West Hollywood karaoke bar to 
                        steal kisses or have secretive sex. Of course, their romance will eventually be discovered and leaked to the press during the president’s heated 
                        reelection campaign. The impossible relationship between Alex and Henry is portrayed with quick wit and clever plotting. The drama, which involves 
                        political rivals, possible betrayals, and even a meeting with the queen, is both irresistible and delicious. Readers will be eager to see more from 
                        McQuiston after this extremely promising start. Agent: Sara Megibow, KT Literary. (June)

                        The much-loved royal romance genre gets a fun and refreshing update in McQuiston's debut.
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        Alex Claremont-Diaz, son of the American President Ellen Claremont, knows one thing for sure: He hates Henry, the British prince to 
                        whom he is always compared. He lives for their verbal sparring matches, but when one of their fights at a royal wedding goes a bit too far, 
                        they end up falling into a wedding cake and making tabloid headlines. An international scandal could ruin Alex's mother's chances for 
                        re-election, so it's time for damage control. The plan? Alex and Henry must pretend to be best friends, giving the tabloids pictures of their 
                        bromance and neutralizing the threat to Ellen's presidency. But after a few photo ops with Henry, Alex starts to realize that the passionate 
                        anger he feels toward him might be a cover for regular old passion. There are, naturally, a million roadblocks between their first kiss and 
                        their happily-ever-after—how can American political royalty and actual British royalty ever be together? How can they navigate being 
                        open about their sexualities (Alex is bisexual; Henry is gay) in their very public and very scrutinized roles? Alex and Henry must decide 
                        if they'll risk their futures, their families, and their careers to take a chance on happiness. Although the story's premise might be a fantasy
                        —it takes place in a world in which a divorced-mom Texan Democrat won the 2016 election—the emotions are all real. The love affair 
                        between Alex and Henry is intense and romantic, made all the more so by the inclusion of their poetic emails that manage to be both funny 
                        and steamy. McQuiston's strength is in dialogue; her characters speak in hilarious rapid-fire bursts with plenty of "likes," "ums," creative 
                        punctuation, and pop-culture references, sounding like smarter, funnier versions of real people. Although Alex and Henry's relationship is 
                        the heart of the story, their friends and family members are all rich, well-drawn characters, and their respective worlds feel both realistic and 
                        larger-than-life.

                        Narrator Ramón de Ocampo brings out all the emotion in this tender, serious, funny, and warmly hopeful love story. Smart, snarky Alex 
                        Claremont-Diaz, first son of the United States, is about to graduate from Georgetown and is eager to work on his mother’s reelection campaign. 
                        Then he falls headlong into a whirlwind and very secret romance with England’s Prince Henry. De Ocampo beautifully conveys the depth of 
                        feeling in their late-night text and email exchanges and intimate physical encounters. Alex gets a hint of a Texas twang and Henry a wobbly but 
                        endearing British accent as de Ocampo differentiates among the large cast of supporting characters in orbit around them. Listeners will be swept 
                        up as Alex and Henry face questions of identity and coming out amid familial duties and political machinations. J.M.D. 2019 Best Audiobook,

                        Narrator Ramón de Ocampo brings out all the emotion in this tender, serious, funny, and warmly hopeful love story. Smart, snarky Alex 
                        Claremont-Diaz, first son of the United States, is about to graduate from Georgetown and is eager to work on his mother’s reelection campaign. 
                        Then he falls headlong into a whirlwind and very secret romance with England’s Prince Henry. De Ocampo beautifully conveys the depth of 
                        feeling in their late-night text and email exchanges and intimate physical encounters. Alex gets a hint of a Texas twang and Henry a wobbly but 
                        endearing British accent as de Ocampo differentiates among the large cast of supporting characters in orbit around them. Listeners will be swept 
                        up as Alex and Henry face questions of identity and coming out amid familial duties and political machinations. J.M.D. 2019 Best Audiobook,
