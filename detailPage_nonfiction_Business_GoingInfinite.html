                    From the incomparable Michael Lewis (Moneyball, The Big Short) comes the wild 
                    and still ongoing story of Sam Bankman-Fried and the world of cryptocurrency. 
                    This is as much a character portrait as it is an exploration of a pocket of the 
                    financial industry that still baffles so many.

                    In Going Infinite Lewis sets out to answer this question, taking readers into the 
                    mind of Bankman-Fried, whose rise and fall offers an education in high-frequency 
                    trading, cryptocurrencies, philanthropy, bankruptcy, and the justice system. Both 
                    psychological portrait and financial roller-coaster ride, Going Infinite is Michael 
                    Lewis at the top of his game, tracing the mind-bending trajectory of a character 
                    who never liked the rules and was allowed to live by his own—until it all came 
                    undone.

                    The spectacular collapse of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange and its eccentric billionaire founder Sam Bankman-Fried is sifted in this rollicking 
                    investigation. Bestseller Lewis (The Big Short) casts Bankman-Fried as a stranger-than-fiction figure with no social instincts (he had to train himself 
                    to display facial expressions when coworkers complained about his unchanging blank gaze), a gift for making complex financial trades with iffy data 
                    under severe time pressure, and a philosophy of “effective altruism” that prodded him to accumulate an 11-figure fortune in order to give it away to 
                    good causes. (One save-the-world project was offering Donald Trump money to not run for president in 2024, Lewis reports, a scheme that fizzled 
                    when Trump allegedly demanded a $5 billion payment.) Lewis’s narrative is a symphony of comedic discordance—a scene of Bankman-Fried frantically 
                    playing video games while Vogue editor Anna Wintour lobbies him to attend the Met Gala is a gem—that coalesces into a reconstruction of FTX’s 
                    labyrinthine bankruptcy. Striking a remarkably sympathetic tone, Lewis even implies Bankman-Fried was railroaded and his misdeeds blown out of 
                    proportion. (“From a distance, it became almost taboo to raise any doubts about the nature of Sam’s crime. Up close, it was hard not to have such 
                    doubts.”) The result is a vastly entertaining and sure to be debated saga of money-making at its weirdest. (Oct.)

                        to an unholy amount of reporting... What he began with Moneyball has come into full flower with Going Infinite. Lewis has surveyed a landscape taken 
                        by convention as settled and found it destabilized, at least here and there, by uneven and unreliable information. Perhaps Lewis’s book should encourage 
                        an update, however minuscule, in our own priors."

                        from the book… including S.B.F.’s inane conversation with Anna Wintour about whether he would attend and potentially sponsor the annual Met Gala
                        —“Yup!”—and the revelations about his relationship with Ellison, the consequences of which are now playing out in court….Going Infinite, is a 
                        delightful read, highly entertaining, often insightful and amusing. It’s a character study of one of the most notorious financial figures of our time…. 
                        [Lewis] does not attempt in any way to try to figure out how S.B.F. pulled off what he is accused of doing, other than by revealing that he is one strange 
                        dude, lacking empathy, and capable, apparently, of fleecing billions from his customers."

                        around a mean… By tolerating the idea that hyper-rationalists cannot make sense of the rules of the game the way most people do, Mr Lewis implicitly 
                        asks readers to reconsider whatever they thought they knew about Mr Bankman-Fried. In the court of public opinion, he is already convicted. That’s 
                        reason enough to give this book a read."

                        character and for all the people who lost so much thanks to his actions… Lewis tries to answer the first question he was asked about Bankman-Fried: 
                        who was this guy? The question of his guilt or innocence Lewis leaves to the criminal justice system. I think that’s good practice, given that the trial is 
                        happening right now. For what it’s worth, I see no contradiction between the person described in Going Infinite and the things SBF is accused of having 
                        done. In fact I think the book makes it easier to understand how and why he did what he allegedly did."

                        Lewis landed on Sam Bankman-Fried’s story at just about the time his short-lived cryptocurrency empire was crumbling. By the author’s account, 
                        Bankman-Fried seems to have had good intentions: He thought of himself as an evangelist for altruistic investing, and his fortune—and on paper he was 
                        worth billions—was intended to “address the biggest existential threats to life on earth: nuclear wars, pandemics far more deadly than Covid, artificial 
                        intelligence that turned on mankind and wiped us out, and so on.” But Bankman-Fried is socially inept, a poor spokesperson for his own causes; he thinks 
                        obliquely, and to a surprising extent, according to the author, he seems to care little about money as such. There’s the rub, for, as federal prosecutors are 
                        even now exploring, billions of his investors’ dollars went missing. That seems not to have been uncommon. “Crypto exchanges routinely misplaced or lost 
                        their customers’ money,” Lewis writes. Was that a criminal act in this case? Lewis ventures no definitive judgment. Instead, to an annoying extent, he seems 
                        to explain it away by infantilizing Bankman-Fried, who, at the time of the collapse, “was only twenty-nine years old.” That’s plenty old enough to be a 
                        crook, but Lewis runs with the misunderstood-child trope all the same: “His general demeanor was that of a kid pretending to be interested when his parents 
                        hauled him into the living room to meet their friends”; “He could see he was different from most other kids”; “He did not have any particular hostility 
                         toward governments or banks. He just thought grown-ups were pointless.” It’s a curious tack that calls some of the author’s reporting into question.     
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        Not Lewis’ best work, but an intriguing portrait with a useful takeaway: Don’t invest in crypto.
