                        Gr 8 Up—A smart, twisted, and unpredictable YA mystery that will have readers guessing until the very end. This debut novel follows four 
                        high school students thrown together in detention with the creator of their school's gossip app. All of them come out alive. The creator doesn't.
                         And now they are all suspects in his murder. Each student takes a turn at narrating, and tension builds as secrets are revealed in a way that 
                        mirrors the gossip app. Who is telling the truth? Who is lying? McManus uses alternating viewpoints to tell the story. Each chapter is short and 
                        quick, which makes the plot move at a fast pace and will engage readers. At the beginning, keeping characters straight might be a tough task for 
                        some, but it is easy to understand the motives of each character, and they soon become easier to distinguish. This factor makes it hard to know 
                        who is guilty and who is innocent. VERDICT A strong selection for teens interested in contemporary YA mysteries and thrillers.

                        Four actors deliver the alternating narratives of four high school students who are accused of murder. Narrator Kim Mai Guest reflects Bronwyn’s
                        wit as well as her humiliation when she’s caught cheating. Robbie Daymond affects the outwardly careless attitude of Nate, a drug dealer, along 
                       with his hidden tenderness. Shannon McManus depicts timid Addy, who at first is cowed by a dominating boyfriend but who later reveals her true
                        courage. With a Southern accent, MacLeod Andrews portrays Cooper, who affects nonchalance in the face of his bullying father before revealing 
                       what he’s really afraid of—his own sexuality and his father’s homophobia. The unity of the four narrators captures the devastation of shame and 
                       the power of overcoming wrongs. S.W. © AudioFile 2017, Portland, Maine

                        Detention takes a dark turn when the student behind Bayview High's infamous app About That dies from a peanut allergy—and every witness has a
                        different reason for wanting him gone.Although McManus' debut initially feels like a rehashing of The Breakfast Club, with five teens from disparate 
                       social circles brought together through detention, there is no bonding through library dance parties or atypical lipstick application. Instead, Bronwyn,
                        Nate, Cooper, and Addy witness Simon collapse and ultimately die after taking a sip of water. When police discover the drink was laced with peanut
                        oil—and that Simon was going to reveal life-ruining secrets about all four students on his gossip app the next day—they go from unfortunate witnesses 
                       to top murder suspects. With each teen ("brain," "criminal," "jock," and "princess," respectively; "walking teen-movie stereotypes," as Simon says)
                        narrating alternating chapters, the novel offers insights into common adolescent struggles—from the pressure to succeed to an alcoholic, out-of-work
                        father—as well as an unlikely romance and opportunities for self-reflection as the investigation escalates. Although their suburban San Diego high 
                       school is a multicultural place, with the exception of Latina Bronwyn, the principal cast is white. Although the language and plot sometimes border 
                       on cliché, this fast-paced blend of Gossip Girl, Pretty Little Liars, and classic John Hughes will leave readers racing to the finish as the try to unravel
                        the mystery on their own. (Thriller. 14-18)
