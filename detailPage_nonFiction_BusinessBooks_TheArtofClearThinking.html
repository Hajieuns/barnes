                <p>
                    <strong>HASARD LEE</strong> is a U.S Air Force fighter pilot who began his career flying the F-16. 
                    As a flight commander he led his pilots into combat during one of the most intense 
                    periods during the War in Afghanistan. There he flew over eighty combat missions 
                    and became the only fighter pilot to ever fly two different types of jets into combat 
                    on the same day while supporting troops under fire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hasard was then hand-picked to fly the F-35—the most advanced and expensive 
                    weapons system in history—which was still in development at the time. During his 
                    last role on active duty, Hasard became the Chief of Training Systems for the largest 
                    training base in the world, leading the development of new technology and teaching 
                    methods to train future fighter pilots. Hasard speaks and consults for organizations. 
                    His social-media accounts reach over 290 million people annually. The Art of Clear 
                    Thinking is his first book.

                    This book will sharpen your ability to stop, see clearly, and make the key choices that may change the entire course of your future."

                    “Hasard’s great service with this book is to put the reader in the seat of the 5th generation fighter pilot, the world’s foremost 
                    laboratory for high pressure, high consequence human decisions, and then share their sophisticated and proven decision insights in 
                    an easy to read and apply manner. All with stories that take place at Mach speed and will have you turning the page. As someone 
                    who spent decades leading special operations, pursuing high-risk sports like BASE jumping and speedflying but also as a business 
                    entrepreneur, I’ve incorporated Hasard’s incredibly valuable decision-making tools into the complex world I experience daily, and 
                    you will too.” —Dan Schilling, Lt. Col. USAF (ret.), Black Hawk Down veteran, Guinness world record extreme athlete, and New

                    "As a former fighter pilot with two tours in Vietnam, I loved this book. For over a hundred years aerial combatants have shared their 
                    death defying stories. The examples Hasard shares, though, are more than simply exciting flying stories. When he describes rolling in 
                    with his gun and raining down 100 rounds per second on the bad guys to save U.S. lives, it’s not simply for braggadocio. It helps 
                    readers learn about resourcefulness and planning when lives are on the line. And it also helps the executive to deal with adversity in a 
                    fluid situation where millions of dollars are at stake in the C-Suite. This book is replete with examples from aviation and industry that will 
                    help you to make better decisions. I relished reading this book and wholeheartedly recommend it without reservation." —George Nolly, 
                    315 combat missions over Vietnam, 24 Air Medals and 3 Distinguished Flying Crosses, last pilot to complete 100 missions over 
                    North Vietnam, Author

                    “This book brought me right back to my days flying fighters, but also to my time in space. I couldn’t put it down. Even more than the heart-
                    pounding fighter pilot stories, Hasard has some powerful and practical words of wisdom for any leader, on Earth or in space!” —Terry Virts,
                     NASA Astronaut, International Space Station Commander, Test Pilot, Author

                <span>
                    "As a former CIA intelligence officer, I place a premium value on processes that enable you to make quick decisions—to manage chaos, 
                    mitigate risk, and employ sound judgment under the most stressful conditions. In Hasard's book, we learn from the best—an F-35 fighter 
                    pilot and trainer—the intricacies of how to make sound decisions on the fly. Decision-making is such a critical life skill, yet one rarely 
                    taught to the general public, until now. Hasard's well-honed decision-making process can transform your operations and output, giving 
                    you the advantage in a world full of uncertainty and risk." —Michele Rigby Assad, Former undercover CIA agent, Author

                <span>
                    "Strap in and hold on as Hasard Lee lights the afterburner on leadership and risk management under extreme pressure. The Art of Clear 
                    Thinking is a riveting read, full of instantly actionable advice—not just for high-stakes decisions, but also for handling everyday choices 
                    at work and home." —Scott Parazynski, 5x NASA shuttle Astronaut, Astronaut Hall of Fame, credited with saving the Space Station 
                    during STS-120, Physician, Inventor, Tech CEO, Author             
                </span>
                <span>
                    "Hasard's book will be transformative for artists, business people and creative entrepreneurs of all backgrounds. As an artist, I've witnessed 
                    how true creativity is forged from crucible moments, and Hasard is an expert on this topic. His stories paint vivid visuals of split second life 
                    & death decisions. They transport you into the cockpit of a full-throttle F-35 fighter jet galloping across the sky at 1,200 mph, when every 
                    minor mistake or deviation could end in a fiery oblivion. Do you have the strength to handle such stress? Most human beings would quickly
                     crumble into fine Sonoran desert sand. Luckily for you, Hasard can be your coach and guide with this book—page by page, generously 
                    sharing his hard-earned secrets, and making you stronger, more confident, faster, wiser." —Drue Kataoka, Artist, technologist, Creator of 
                    the first art exhibit in space, CEO of Drue Kataoka Studios, Clubhouse Icon with 750k+ followers

                    "Flying a hundred million dollars worth of state secrets over enemy territory at more than a thousand miles per hour takes a lot of guts, but 
                    most people don’t realize that just getting there, climbing into that cockpit, takes a huge amount of trust. Fighter pilots don’t have the benefit 
                    of direct oversight, they have to make critical decisions in fractions of a second, using only the information at hand, and the stakes can often 
                    be higher than just life or death. One bad decision behind the stick of an advanced fighter, and you could throw your entire nation into conflict.             
                </span>
                <span>
                    But this book from F-35 pilot Hasard Lee demonstrated with crystal clarity that making the right call isn’t a matter of chance, it’s a matter of 
                    process. It doesn’t matter if you’re flying a combat mission over Iraq or you’re taking a Zoom meeting from your home office, Hasard’s 
                    methodical approach to assessing your options, making a call, and owning your outcomes will have you thinking like a fighter pilot, and 
                    making mission like one too. Born out of scientific analysis, real combat experience, and fighter pilot culture, Hasard pulls the decision-
                    making skills that make a fighter pilot out of the cockpit and places them in your hands, providing real-world examples from his experiences 
                    flying America’s most advanced jets alongside practical examples of these same principles being leveraged in far more grounded business and
                     commercial settings. Aviation lovers will revel in Hasard’s first-accounts of flying incredible aircraft, but literally everyone can benefit from 
                    this crash course in decision making." —Alex Hollings, Editor-in-Chief of Sandboxx News (1M+ monthly active visitors)
