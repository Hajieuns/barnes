                    In this spellbinding portrait of obsession and flawed genius, the best-selling author 
                    of The Stranger in the Woods brings us into Breitwieser’s strange world—unlike

                    For centuries, works of art have been stolen in countless ways from all over the 
                    world, but no one has been quite as successful at it as the master thief Stéphane 
                    Breitwieser. Carrying out more than two hundred heists over nearly eight years—in 
                    museums and cathedrals all over Europe—Breitwieser, along with his girlfriend who 
                    worked as his lookout, stole more than three hundred objects, until it all fell apart in 
                    spectacular fashion.        
                </p>
                <p>
                    In The Art Thief, Michael Finkel brings us into Breitwieser’s strange and fascinating 
                    world. Unlike most thieves, Breitwieser never stole for money. Instead, he displayed 
                    all his treasures in a pair of secret rooms where he could admire them to his heart’s 
                    content. Possessed of a remarkable athleticism and an innate ability to circumvent 
                    practically any security system, Breitwieser managed to pull off a breathtaking 
                    number of audacious thefts. Yet these strange talents bred a growing disregard for 
                    risk and an addict’s need to score, leading Breitwieser to ignore his girlfriend’s pleas 
                    to stop—until one final act of hubris brought everything crashing down.

                    In this masterful true crime account, Finkel (The Stranger in the Woods) traces the fascinating exploits of Stéphane Breitwieser, a French 
                    art thief who stole more than 200 artworks from across Europe between 1995 and 2001, turning his mother’s attic into a glittering trove 
                    of oil paintings, silver vessels, and antique weaponry. Mining extensive interviews with Breitwieser himself, and several with those who 
                    detected and prosecuted him, Finkel meticulously restages the crimes, describing the castles and museums that attracted Breitwieser and 
                    Anne-Catherine Kleinklaus, his accomplice and romantic partner; the luminous oils and sculptures that caught Breitwieser’s eye; and the 
                    swift, methodical actions he took to liberate his prizes. According to Breitwieser, his sole motive was aesthetic: to possess great beauty, 
                    to “gorge on it.” Drawing on art theory and Breitwieser’s psychology reports, Finkel speculates on his subject’s addiction to beauty and 
                    on Anne-Catherine’s acquiescence to the crimes. The account is at its best when it revels in the audacity of the escapades, including feats 
                    of misdirection in broad daylight, and the slow, inexorable pace of the law. It’s a riveting ride. (June)

                        Stéphane Breitweiser, the world's most prolific art thief, who stole paintings and objects from more than 200 museums across Europe over a 
                        span of eight years. The value of the stolen items, some difficult to price, is estimated to be $1-$2 billion. Breitweiser says he never stole for 
                        money. Instead, he views himself as a collector who takes art only in the daytime, without violence, when a museum is open to the public. 
                        From the opening chapter, Finkel's tight prose heightens the drama of each theft, as Breitweiser and his girlfriend Anne-Catherine Kleinklaus, 
                        who serves as his lookout, enter Belgium's Rubens House amid visitors and guards. Breitweiser leaves with an ivory sculpture of Adam and 
                        Eve, which he adds to his secret galley in his mother's house in France. Finkel also researches Breitweiser's motivation and insatiable hunger 
                        for possessing beautiful things, which makes for a fascinating read. VERDICT Finkel will have art history and true crime lovers obsessively 
                        turning the pages of this suspenseful, smartly written work until its shocking conclusion.—Denise Miller

                        The tale of a strong candidate for the title of "most prolific art thief ever.”   
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        Stéphane Breitwieser (b. 1971) claimed that his sole motivation for stealing was to surround himself with beauty. Over eight years and more 
                        than 200 heists, he made off with an estimated $1.4 billion to $1.9 billion worth of loot. Expanding on an article he wrote for GQ, Finkel, the 
                        author of The Stranger in the Woods, follows the string of Breitwieser's thefts across Europe. His crimes are particularly fascinating because 
                        Breitwieser kept all of his booty, displayed for his delectation, in the attic of his mother's house in Mulhouse, an industrial city in eastern 
                        France. He considered himself an "art collector with an unorthodox acquisition style” or an “art liberator who did not steal for monetary gain.” 
                        He purloined masterpieces from sparsely protected regional museums during daylight hours, evading guards and tourists through skill and 
                        timing. Finkel’s play-by-play of each theft has the pacing and atmosphere of a good suspense tale. We learn which objects stir the thief's 
                        passions and how his "sweet spot" was Northern European "cabinet paintings" from the 16th and 17th centuries, small works that are easier 
                        to pilfer. The author describes each acquisition as well as Breitwieser's simple but effective methods. For example, he used his only tool, a Swiss 
                        Army knife, to effect a "silicone slice" into museum display cases. The catalog of plundered works is extensive, and the book will contain two 
                        maps and an eight-page color insert featuring some of the stolen art. Finkel makes a valuable addition to existing media reports from Breitwieser's 
                        trials; an earlier account, Vincent Noce’s The Selfish Collection; and the art thief's own, ghostwritten, memoir, Confessions of an Art Thief. 
                        Arrested in 2019, Breitwieser awaits another trial this April.

                        The Art Thief, like its title character, has confidence, élan, and a great sense of timing. It is propelled by suspense and surprises....This ultra-
                        lucrative, odds-defying crime streak is wonderfully narrated by Finkel, in a tale whose trajectory is less rise and fall than crazy and crazier....
                        Part of what makes Finkel’s book so much fun is that, without exception, [Breitwieser’s] strategies are insane."

                    <span>
                        "A mesmerizing true-crime psychological thriller....The Art Thief develops the tension of a French policier, where the crook (for whom you 
                        alternately feel sympathy and disgust) has Maigret or Poirot hot on his trail. The final outcome is a shock. Mr. Finkel tells an enthralling story. 
                        From start to finish, this book is hard to put down."

                        "Meticulously detailed, [a] page-turning account....As much a crime caper as a psychological thriller, Finkel’s narrative interweaves gripping 
                        descriptions of Breitweiser’s in-plain-sight thefts armed with nothing more than stealth and a Swiss Army knife, a concise history of global art 
                        theft, and psychologists’ musings on Breitwieser’s unconscious motivations....Finkel deftly keeps us swaying between great sympathy for his 
                        central character and profound suspicion."

                        “It is romantic to liken art thieves to Pierce Brosnan’s glamorous character in The Thomas Crown Affair. The reality is far less charming. Case 
                        in point: Stéphane Breitwieser, one of the most successful art thieves of all time. From roughly 1994 to 2001, Breitwieser executed more than 
                        200 heists. The book’s first lesson? Europe has a lot of understaffed historic buildings. The second? Even a kleptomaniac with delusions of 
                        grandeur can be made mildly sympathetic in the hands of a skilled writer.”

                        Breitwieser’s psychology reports, Finkel speculates on his subject’s addiction to beauty....It’s a riveting ride."
