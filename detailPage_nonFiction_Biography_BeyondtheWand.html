                <p>
                    Known around the world as the big screen embodiment of Harry Potter's wizarding 
                    nemesis, Tom Felton offers his legions of fans a candid and witty account of life in 
                    the wizarding world. Recounting the friendships and trials of fame, Tom will 
                    #always be a fan favorite.          
                </p>
                <p class="bold">
                    From the magical moments on set as Draco Malfoy to the challenges of growing up 
                    in the spotlight, get a backstage pass into Tom Felton’s life on and off the big screen 
                    in this #1 New York Times bestseller, now in paperback!   
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tom Felton’s adolescence was anything but ordinary. His early rise to fame in 
                    beloved films like The Borrowers catapulted him into the limelight, but nothing 
                    could prepare him for what was to come after he landed the iconic role of the Draco 
                    Malfoy, the bleached blonde villain of the Harry Potter movies. For the next ten 
                    years, he was at the center of a huge pop culture phenomenon and yet, in between 
                    filming, he would go back to being a normal teenager trying to fit into a normal 
                    school.       
                </p>
                <p>
                    Speaking with great candor and his signature humor, Tom shares his experience 
                    growing up as part of the wizarding world while also trying to navigate the muggle 
                    world. He tells stories from his early days in the business like his first acting gig 
                    where he was mistaken for fellow blonde child actor Macaulay Culkin and his 
                    Harry Potter audition where, in a very Draco-like move, he fudged how well he 
                    knew the books the series was based on (not at all). He reflects on his experiences 
                    working with cinematic greats such as Alan Rickman, Sir Michael Gambon, Dame 
                    Maggie Smith, and Ralph Fiennes (including that awkward Voldemort hug). And, 
                    perhaps most poignantly, he discusses the lasting relationships he made over that 
                    decade of filming, including with Emma Watson, who started out as a pesky nine-
                    year-old whom he mocked for not knowing what a boom mic was but who soon 
                    grew into one of his dearest friends. Then, of course, there are the highs and lows of 
                    fame and navigating life after such a momentous and life-changing experience.         
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now with a new chapter for the paperback that delves into Felton's experience of 
                    fame, Beyond the Wand is an entertaining, funny, and poignant must-read for any 
                    Harry Potter fan. Prepare to meet a real-life wizard.

                    Actor Felton, best known for his portrayal of bleached-blond antagonist Draco Malfoy in the Harry Potter films, recounts his career in his 
                    charming debut memoir. Raised in the 1980s in the London suburb of Surrey, Felton’s first on-screen role, at age nine, was in the 1997 film 
                    The Borrowers; three years later, he earned the part of Draco. Felton recalls tender memories of support from his family, such as how his 
                    grandfather taught him how to perform the distinctive Draco sneer. Felton also reveals his struggle to maintain a sense of normalcy during his 
                    teenage years; later, after moving to L.A., he became disillusioned with the persona he’d cultivated, which made him feel lonely. Felton’s 
                    narrative is both self-deprecating (“I was born enthusiastic rather than talented”) and frank; he discusses the drinking problem he developed 
                    in his 20s and advocates for the destigmatization of mental health problems. He regards praise from fellow actors with a grain of salt, but 
                    treasures the written accolades he received from author J.K. Rowling. Felton weaves a seamless, sensitive narrative that will enchant Potterheads 
                    and fans of celebrity memoirs alike. Agent: Stephanie Thwaites, Curtis Brown. (Oct.)

                        translates his tale into something more universal. Sure, the “boy who lived” was never Draco’s moniker — but considering his eventful existence, 
                        it suits Felton just fine.”—The Washington Post

                        A memoir about the author's precocious acting career, which began at the tender age of 10. Felton says that he was just an average kid obsessed with
                        football and fishing when his life changed after being cast as bad boy Draco Malfoy in the Harry Potter film series. By the time of the Harry Potter 
                       auditions in 1999, Felton had already performed in prominent film roles: as Jim Broadbent's son in The Borrowers, and as Jodie Foster's son in Anna 
                       and the King. Then he auditioned, along with thousands of others, to play series protagonist Harry Potter, but his cockiness and nonchalance impressed 
                       director Chris Columbus, who thought he was a good choice to play Harry's adversary, Malfoy. The film franchise would catapult Felton and his costars to 
                       international superstardom, as Felton describes here. He tells illuminating stories about typical days on the Harry Potter set, the filming of complex scenes 
                       (particularly the series' famous flying Quidditch scenes), working with animals, and his relationships with peer costars Daniel Radcliff, Emily Watson, 
                       Robert Grint and the film's notable veteran actors (including Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman). He is especially forthcoming about his success, which he re
                       flects as almost accidental, and a dark period following the Harry Potter years, when he battled addiction and spent time in rehab. VERDICT An honest, 
                       at times humorous, and entertaining memoir that movie buffs, especially Harry Potter fans, will enjoy.—Phillip Oliver

                        What made Draco Malfoy such a memorable movie villain was the feeling that there was more to him than viewers were able to see. It turns out the
                        same goes for the actor who played him. Felton fills much of his memoir with charmingly told behind-the-scenes stories of what it was like filming th
                       e eight movies in the Harry Potter series. He recalls how he brushed off Emma Watson in their first meeting and how she once slapped him in the fac
                       e. “I didn’t have the cojones to tell Emma that I hadn’t meant her to thwack me in the face, or that she nearly had me in tears,” he writes. The autho
                       r’s anecdotes about his co-stars, from Daniel Radcliffe to Judi Dench, are similarly sweet and self-deprecating. However, as he fondly recalls his non
                       chalant reaction to his early career as a child actor and how his tightknit family kept him grounded, there is foreshadowing of potential problems, p
                       articularly when the Harry Potter films concluded. “I craved an escape from the version of myself I was becoming,” he explained. “I craved the old 
                       me. I craved authenticity.” Suddenly, Felton’s studied British charm and detached cool were replaced with the frenzied discomfort of a man struggling
                        with very real demons. To his credit, the author is as unflinchingly forthcoming during this period as he is in the rest of his life. “Part of the reason 
                       that I took the decision to write these pages,” he writes, “is the hope that by sharing my experiences, I might be able to help someone else who is strug
                       gling….I’m no longer shy of putting my hands up and saying: I’m not okay. To this day I never know which version of myself I’m going to wake up to.”
