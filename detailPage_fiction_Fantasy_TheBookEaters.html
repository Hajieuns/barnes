                <p>
                    We love books about books and stories about stories, but here is a gothic fantasy 
                    about a family that literally eats books to consume knowledge. This extraordinary 
                    debut is a story of sacrifice and betrayal, queer identity and acceptance, and what 
                    makes a monster.

                    grow up feasting on stories of valor and adventure, and Devon—like all other book 
                    eater women—is raised on a carefully curated diet of fairy tales and cautionary 
                    stories.

                <span>
                    "Raw and imaginative, this gritty, gothic anti-fairytale knows the truth: love will make a villain out of anyone."

                </span>
                <span>
                    “Innovative, unique, poignant, and told with a voice as original as the story itself. I finished this novel in that one sitting, yet 
                    I’ll be pondering it for a long time to come. This is the debut of a new master of the modern fantasy. Don’t miss it.”
                    —James Rollins, #1 New York Times bestseller of The Starless Crown 
                </span>
                <span>
                    "This beautiful, delicate, cruel, utterly unique look at tradition, motherhood, trauma, and what it means to be a monster would 
                    be a masterpiece from an established author. As a debut, it is nothing short of stunning. It kept surprising me all the way to the end.”

                <span>
                    "A powerful story of overwhelming mother love, as something both powerful and potentially horrific. It’s a book that delves into 
                    the need to survive even when a system is built to break you or determined to crush you; a powerful queer story about difference that 
                    refuses to flinch away from difficult choices or the impact of trauma, both generational and inflicted. Readers will devour this compelling, 
                    rich fantasy."—Booklist, starred review

                    “A darkly sweet pastry of a book about family, betrayal, and the lengths we go to for the ones we love. Great reading for a rainy 
                    morning, with tea or coffee on, a cat in your lap, and nowhere to be but lost in a delicious modern fairy tale.”

                        Dean’s unputdownable debut gives the phrase “voracious reader” a new, very literal meaning. Devon isn’t human. She and others like 
                        her live off eating books, and they retain all the knowledge they consume. Book eaters are rare, and book eater girls are even rarer. 
                        Raised by the isolated, cultish Family, Devon is treated like a breakable princess and fed a steady diet of fairy tales in which the girls are 
                        always the damsels in distress. Devon’s duty is to grow up and produce two children by two different husbands to ensure the survival of 
                        their species. Willful and stubborn in nature, Devon has always chafed under the Family’s control—and when her first son is born not a 
                        book eater but a far more dangerous mind eater, she goes on the run to save the boy from the Family, who no longer want him. But to 
                        survive, she’ll have to find a way to sate the hunger that plagues him, a hunger far more sinister and alien than her own. The fascinating 
                        magic system, impeccable and unusual worldbuilding, and well-shaded characters will keep readers riveted through every twist of this 
                        wild ride. Gothic fantasy fans will want to snap up this thrilling tale. (Aug.)

                        Dean's outstanding debut introduces a unique world featuring a clan of book eaters, people for whom books are food. Devon Fairweather, 
                        a female book eater, has been treated as a princess and is fed a carefully curated diet of fairy tales so that she fulfills her duty—to ensure 
                        the continuity of The Family by producing two children with two different fathers. When her son, Cai, is born, not as a book eater, but as 
                        a mind eater, she goes on the run to save him from a ghastly fate. Despite almost immediately experiencing the horrors Devon will visit 
                        upon humankind to protect her child, it is hard not to root for her, as her love feels so strong and pure. Katie Erich narrates Devon with 
                        the voice of a true storyteller, providing a mesmerizing performance that communicates the devastating harshness and rich emotionality of 
                        Devon's journey. Erich's calm tone is pleasantly grounded in a story that could be too dark, complex, or morally gray for some. VERDICT 
                        This is the type of dark fantasy that breaks out of the genre and into popular culture. Beautiful and intense, it is a must-listen.

                        DEBUT Devon Fairweather, a book eater, knew she was special: treated as a princess among her brothers, raised in an isolated home with her 
                        extended family, and fed fairy tales—quite literally, as the book eaters consume volumes of written words and retain all the knowledge within. 
                        Devon's fairy-tale life soon meets hard reality, as she, like all book eater females, is expected to ensure The Family's survival and bear two 
                        children by two husbands. However, Devon wants more; she wants a life on her own terms and with her children. When her son Cai is born 
                        and consumes minds instead of books, Devon escapes with him before The Family can destroy him, or worse. Devon takes drastic action to 
                        satisfy Cai's hunger, which is far more deadly than her own, but what would a mother not do for her child? The fantastical world does not 
                        overshadow the novel's dramatic themes, including family, self-determination, and the morally gray choices one makes for those they love. 
                        VERDICT A fascinating debut with shades of gothic fantasy and contemporary thriller, wrapped in a narrative full of vivid and detailed 
                        characters and worldbuilding, and an unusual premise.—Kristi Chadwick

                        Katie Erich’s Northern English accent transports listeners to the windswept Yorkshire moors in this atmospheric fantasy about a woman on the run. 
                        Devon grows up among book eaters—a mysterious species that consumes books instead of food. When her son is born with a rare condition that gives 
                        him a hunger for human brains, not books, she sets off on a dangerous journey to save him—and herself. Erich’s pacing is perfect. She delivers 
                        breathless chase scenes at a fever pitch and voices Devon’s thoughts with a constant edge of fear and desperation. Her portrayal of Devon’s son, a 
                        five-year-old who has consumed the minds of grown humans, is both chilling and heartbreaking. This is a darkly beautiful book about violent family 
                        legacies and impossible choices. L.S. © AudioFile 2022, Portland, Maine
