                <h3>Notes From Your Bookseller</h3>
                <p>
                    In the pack of well-known founding fathers, Samuel Adams, second cousin to 
                    President John Adams, has remained an enigma. In The Revolutionary, Pulitzer 
                    Prize-winning historian and biographer Stacy Schiff, teases out a captivating, 
                    detailed portrait of this historical actor and the Revolution he helped make, 
                    revealing the fiery orator, fierce patriot, master of tactics, strategy, and motivation; 
                    a pivotal figure, confident in conviction, yet most comfortable behind the curtain. 
                    Once again Schiff offers new, exciting perspective on what we thought familiar.          
                </p>
                <p class="bold">
                    This "glorious" revelatory biography from a Pulitzer Prize winner is about the most 
                    essential Founding Father (Ron Chernow)—the one who stood behind the change in 
                    thinking that produced the American Revolution.     
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thomas Jefferson asserted that if there was any leader of the Revolution, “Samuel 
                    Adams was the man.” With high-minded ideals and bare-knuckle tactics, Adams led 
                    what could be called the greatest campaign of civil resistance in American history.   
                    Stacy Schiff returns Adams to his seat of glory, introducing us to the shrewd and 
                    eloquent man who supplied the moral backbone of the American Revolution. A 
                    singular figure at a singular moment, Adams amplified the Boston Massacre. He 
                    helped to mastermind the Boston Tea Party. He employed every tool available to 
                    rally a town, a colony, and eventually a band of colonies behind him, creating the 
                    cause that created a country. For his efforts he became the most wanted man in 
                    America: When Paul Revere rode to Lexington in 1775, it was to warn Samuel 
                    Adams that he was about to be arrested for treason. In The Revolutionary: Samuel 
                    Adams, Schiff brings her masterful skills to Adams’s improbable life, illuminating 
                    his transformation from aimless son of a well-off family to tireless, beguiling radical 
                    who mobilized the colonies. Arresting, original, and deliriously dramatic, this is a 
                    long-overdue chapter in the history of our nation.

                    Portraying Adams as both a pious Puritan and a man of action, who “muscled words into deeds” in the cause of American independence, and 
                    whose destruction of most of his personal papers opened the door for adversaries to characterize him as a propagandist who provoked mob 
                    violence, Schiff begins the narrative with a dramatic description of the opening stages of the Revolutionary War, revealing that the main objective 
                    of Paul Revere’s ride was to warn Adams that the British were coming. From there, Schiff retraces Adams’s early years in Boston, his entry into 
                    Harvard at age 14, and the “financial catastrophe” that rocked the family when the British parliament dissolved a Massachusetts land bank cofounded 
                    by his father. “Vigilance in civic life,” writes Schiff, “had been inculcated in at an early age.” By the late 1740s, he was writing political pieces for local 
                    newspapers and soon became a leading opponent of new tariffs and regulations on the colonies. Throughout, Schiff vividly recounts major events in 
                    the lead-up to the Revolutionary War, including the Stamp Act Crisis, the Boston Massacre, and the Boston Tea Party, and draws incisive sketches of 
                    Loyalist governor Thomas Hutchinson, Patriot lawyer James Otis, and others. Fast-paced and enlightening, this is a must-read for colonial history buffs.

                        Though he is typically overshadowed by such towering contemporaries as Washington, Jefferson, and Adams’ second cousin, John Adams, Samuel’s 
                        behind-the-scenes machinations were a crucial factor in setting in motion the wheels of revolution. In her latest, Schiff enthusiastically digs through 
                        much of the limited material available on her subject. In a calculated move, Samuel destroyed countless documents and most of his personal 
                        correspondence, leaving little for future biographers to unearth. “He operated by stealth, melting into committees and crowd actions, pseudonyms and 
                        smoky back rooms,” writes Schiff. “ ‘There ought to be a memorial to Samuel Adams in the CIA,’ quips a modern historian, dubbing him America’s 
                        first covert agent. We are left to read him in the twisted arm, the borrowed set of talking points, the indignation of America’s enemies. We know more
                         about him from his apoplectic adversaries than from his friends, sworn to secrecy.” Schiff exhaustively dissects whatever was written about him by his 
                        contemporaries, and she also explores the numerous politically charged essays that he submitted under pseudonyms to newspapers such as the Boston
                         Gazette, many of which openly criticized British colonial policy. Schiff provides a penetrating analysis of Samuel’s tactics and motivations, and in tracing 
                        his story from his unassuming and somewhat aimless roots as a failed businessman to his role as a highly influential American statesman, she reveals how 
                        his grounded idealism was present from the outset and remained consistent throughout his life. This is a meticulously researched and often eloquent 
                        work of historical biography, but it’s an occasionally dry cerebral exercise, lacking some of the author’s typical storytelling verve. Still, Schiff offers a
                         welcome, fresh study featuring notions of liberty and democracy that feel particularly relevant in today’s consistently tumultuous political landscape.
