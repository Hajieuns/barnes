                <p>
                    (b) <strong>Availability, Quantity and Order Limits.</strong> Not all Digital Content may be available to all users. Availability of Digital Content or the Barnes &amp; Noble

                    Digital Content prices and availability are subject to change at any time and without notice. Barnes &amp; Noble may place a limit on the quantities that 
                    may be purchased per order, per account, per credit card, per person, or per household. If the Digital Content that you ordered is unavailable, we may 
                    contact you to offer you an alternative product. If you do not choose to purchase the alternative product, we will cancel your order.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite our best efforts, on rare occasions an item may be priced incorrectly on the Barnes &amp; Noble Services. If we have made a mistake and the correct 
                    price for the item is actually higher than the price listed on the Barnes &amp; Noble Services at the time of purchase, then we may either (at our sole 
                    discretion): (i) contact you to see whether you want to buy the product at the higher price; (ii) cancel your order for such item and notify you of the 
                    cancellation; or (iii) deliver the item to you at the incorrect lower price to your benefit. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note that this Section 3(c) regarding prices applies only to items sold by us.

                <p>

                    Barnes &amp; Noble Services or to access, download, or use Digital Content. By agreeing to these Digital Content Terms of Sale and using the 
                    Barnes &amp; Noble Services, you agree to receive such Updates automatically. You may be able to manage Updates to certain Barnes &amp; Noble Content via

                    When you sign up for a subscription, you will be asked to provide your credit card information. You hereby authorize us to bill your credit card in 
                    advance for your subscription fees and annually thereafter until your subscription to the Barnes &amp; Noble Audiobooks service terminates, and you 
                    further agree to pay any subscription fees so incurred. You agree to promptly update your account information with any changes (for example, a change 
                    in your billing address or credit card expiration date) that may occur. If we cannot charge your credit card for any fees when due because your payment 
                    information is no longer valid and up-to-date, or if we do not receive your payment when due through the alternative payment method you have selected, 
                    we may, at our election: (a) suspend your access to the portion of the Barnes &amp; Noble Audiobooks service provided on a subscription basis (including 
                    any Credits on your account), in which case you will be responsible for all subscription fees incurred during the period of suspension, or (b) without 
                    waiving our rights to suspend or terminate your account, allow you a longer period during which to make payment, in which case you will remain 
                    responsible for all subscription fees incurred while we await your payment. Late payments incur interest charges at the rate of 1% per month on any 
                    outstanding balance or the maximum amount permitted by applicable law, whichever is less. The fees hereunder do not include any local, state or 
                    federal taxes or duties for transactions arising hereunder. If we are responsible for collecting such taxes based on the transactions under these Digital 
                    Content Terms of Sale, you will be responsible for payment of all such taxes or duties, excluding taxes based on Barnes &amp; Noble’s net income or 
                    property.

                <p>
                    (a) <strong>Digital Content License.</strong> We offer you the ability to purchase or download Digital Content from and through the Barnes &amp; Noble Services for 
                    viewing and use on a Supported Device or via a Barnes &amp; Noble Application, using your Digital Library. We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, 
                    revocable license to access, store and make personal, non-commercial use of the Digital Content in accordance with these Digital Content Terms of Sale. 
                    Your rights to the Digital Content, as set forth herein, will apply even if the amount paid for the Digital Content is zero.
                </p>
                <p>Certain Digital Content, including but not limited to audiobooks or eTextbooks, may be licensed for listening or viewing over a limited period of time. If a limited period license applies to particular content, we will identify the license period in the Barnes &amp; Noble Services. If no license period is identified, then the license period for such Digital Content is indefinite.</p>
                <p>You may generally browse, preview or search Digital Content without having to purchase or download the Digital Content. However, in order to be able to purchase and/or download Digital Content, you must first open a Barnes &amp; Noble account and provide valid credit card information and your billing address to us and either: (i) install the necessary Barnes &amp; Noble Application onto your Supported Device; or (ii) register your Supported Device by logging into your Barnes &amp; Noble account from your Supported Device. If you have difficulty downloading or accessing Digital Content from the Barnes &amp; Noble Services, please contact customer service at help.barnesandnoble.com or 1-800-THE-BOOK (1-800-843-2665) for assistance.</p>
                <p>Your purchased Digital Content will be stored in, or accessible from, your Digital Library. You can access your Digital Library by signing into your Barnes &amp; Noble account. You may also transfer most Digital Content from your Digital Library to no more than a total of six (6) Supported Devices or Barnes &amp; Noble Applications at any one time; however, certain Digital Content, including eTextbooks, may be transferred to no more than a total of two (2) Supported Devices or Barnes &amp; Noble Applications at any one time. You may not transfer Digital Content from one Supported Device to another without maintaining the applicable digital rights management solution for that Digital Content. You may not bypass, modify, defeat or circumvent any of the security features, special rules or other applications that protect Digital Content.</p>
                <p>We reserve the right to modify or discontinue the offering of any Digital Content at any time. If an item of Digital Content becomes unavailable prior to download but after purchase, your sole and exclusive remedy is the refund of the purchase price paid for such Digital Content to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. Some Digital Content may not remain available for re-download from your Digital Library, if for example, the publisher of the Digital Content no longer retains the rights or other licenses, consents or permissions to that Digital Content. Digital Content already downloaded to your Supported Device or Barnes &amp; Noble Application will generally not be affected.</p>
