                <h3>Notes From Your Bookseller</h3>
                <p>
                    Debut author Angeline Boulley has crafted an immersive and heart-stopping thriller 
                    told through the eyes of 18-year-old Daunis, a biracial, unenrolled member of the 
                    Ojibwe tribe. With crystal meth abuse on the rise in her community, Daunis uses 
                    her knowledge of science and native medicine to go undercover as a confidential 
                    informant with the FBI, but what she uncovers makes her question everything she’s 
                    ever known. Boulley’s authentic depictions of the complexities of Native 
                    communities and the trauma and strength of Native women, specifically, make this 
                    book a complete standout for YA and adult readers alike.

                    Eighteen-year-old Daunis Fontaine has never quite fit in, both in her hometown and 
                    on the nearby Ojibwe reservation. She dreams of a fresh start at college, but when 
                    family tragedy strikes, Daunis puts her future on hold to look after her fragile 
                    mother. The only bright spot is meeting Jamie, the charming new recruit on her 
                    brother Levi’s hockey team.        
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yet even as Daunis falls for Jamie, she senses the dashing hockey star is hiding 
                    something. Everything comes to light when Daunis witnesses a shocking murder, 
                    thrusting her into an FBI investigation of a lethal new drug.         
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reluctantly, Daunis agrees to go undercover, drawing on her knowledge of chemistry 
                    and Ojibwe traditional medicine to track down the source. But the search for truth 
                    is more complicated than Daunis imagined, exposing secrets and old scars. At the 
                    same time, she grows concerned with an investigation that seems more focused on 
                    punishing the offenders than protecting the victims.      
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, as the deceptions—and deaths—keep growing, Daunis must learn what it 
                    means to be a strong Anishinaabe kwe (Ojibwe woman) and how far she’ll go for 
                    her community, even if it tears apart the only world she’s ever known.

                    With sharp turns and charming characters, this debut thriller by Annishinabe author Boulley centers 18-year-old Daunis Fontaine, who loves and 
                    fits into her community but yearns for official citizenship in the Sault tribe. Science-minded Daunis had planned on going away for college, but 
                    after her uncle overdoses on meth and her grandmother has a stroke, she stays closer to her Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., home, negotiating a complex 
                    familial situation having to do with her deceased Annishinabe father. After witnessing her best friend’s murder by her meth-reliant boyfriend, she
                     begins looking into the mounting local meth overdoses, using her knowledge of chemistry as well as traditional plants and medicine to source the
                     drug and, amid growing danger, reveal its seller. Featuring prolific use of Anishinaabemowin (Ojibwe language), this wonderfully tribally specific
                     story offers powerful messages about what it can mean to be an Anishinaabe kwe (Ojibwe woman): “complex and sometimes exhausted, but 
                    mostly brave.” Hitting hard when it comes to issues such as citizenship, language revitalization, and the corrosive presence of drugs on Native 
                    communities, this novel will long stand in the hearts of both Native and non-Native audiences. Ages 14–up. Author’s agent: Faye Bender, the 
                    Book Group. (Mar.)

                       investigation into the corruption that led to this pain. An incredible thriller, not to be missed." —Booklist, Starred Review

                        Gr 9 Up—This #OwnVoices novel is a character-driven crime thriller packed with Ojibwe culture and high-stakes tension with themes of identity, 
                        trust, and resilience. The journey of 18-year-old Daunis Fontaine is told in four parts overlaid by the four directions of Ojibwe medicine wheel 
                        teachings. Daunis should be focused on a fresh start at college after her uncle's untimely death. She is sucked back into the world of ice hockey 
                        and starts slowly falling for Jamie, one of her brother's new teammates. Soon she finds herself living two disparate lives: one as a loving daughter,
                         niece, and granddaughter in her family and tribal community, and one as a confidential informant to the FBI as they investigate a deadly new drug. 
                        She dangerously furthers the investigation on her own after witnessing a murder, and ultimately must choose between protecting the people she loves 
                        or protecting her tribal community. Native cultural aspects, such as the central role of Elders in tribal life, the special relationship between aunts and 
                        nieces, and decentering of the individual in favor of the tribe are included, as are some darker aspects of life including drugs, violence, and sexual assault.
                         Daunis, Jamie, and other characters are fleshed out, relatable, and believable, and Daunis's journey to become a strong Ojibwe woman is compelling. 
                        VERDICT A strong crime fiction addition to any library, educators will find this text useful in discussions of character growth, social justice, and 
                        Native issues.—Kara Stewart (Sappony), Literacy Coach & Reading Specialist

                        development—this debut has it all. LaBlanc rises to the challenge, bringing listeners into the mind of this clever and courageous young woman. 
                        Dialogue, including words in other languages, is handled with effortless transitions and clear depictions between characters. This audiobook should

                        Daunis is trying to balance her two communities: The Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, teen is constantly adapting, whether she is with her Anishinaabe 
                        father’s side of the family, the Firekeepers, or the Fontaines, her White mother’s wealthy relatives. She has grand plans for her future, as she wants to
                         become a doctor, but has decided to defer her plans to go away for college because her maternal grandmother is recovering from a stroke. Daunis 
                        spends her free time playing hockey with her Firekeeper half brother, Levi, but tragedy strikes, and she discovers someone is selling a dangerous new 
                        form of meth—and the bodies are piling up. While trying to figure out who is behind this, Daunis pulls away from her family, covering up where she 
                        has been and what she has been doing. While dealing with tough topics like rape, drugs, racism, and death, this book balances the darkness with 
                        Ojibwe cultural texture and well-crafted characters. Daunis is a three-dimensional, realistically imperfect girl trying her best to handle everything 
                        happening around her. The first-person narration reveals her internal monologue, allowing readers to learn what’s going on in her head as she 
                        encounters anti-Indian bias and deals with grief.
