                <p>
                    How would our lives be different if instead of avoiding thoughts of our mortality 
                    we embraced them? Would our lives be richer and happier if we were intentional 
                    about how we spent our time on earth with that awareness in mind? Four Thousand 
                    Weeks is thought provoking and timely.

                    There’s a good reason why everyone has been talking about Oliver Burkeman’s New 
                    York Times bestseller, Four Thousand Weeks. Nobody needs to be told there isn’t 
                    enough time. Whether we’re starting our own business, or trying to write a novel 
                    during our lunch break, or staring down a pile of deadlines as we’re planning a 
                    vacation, we’re obsessed with our lengthening to-do lists, overfilled inboxes, work-
                    life balance, and ceaseless struggle against distraction. We’re deluged with advice on 
                    becoming more productive and efficient and life hacks to optimize our days. But 
                    such techniques often end up making things worse. The sense of anxious hurry 
                    grows more intense, and yet the most meaningful parts of life seem to lie just beyond 
                    the horizon. Still, we rarely make the connection between our daily struggles with 
                    time and the ultimate time management problem: the challenge of how best to use 
                    our four thousand weeks, the average length of a human life.          
                </p>
                <p>
                    Drawing on the insights of both ancient and contemporary philosophers, 
                    psychologists, and spiritual teachers, Oliver Burkeman delivers an entertaining, 
                    humorous, practical, and ultimately profound guide to time and time management. 
                    Rejecting the futile modern obsession with “getting everything done,” Four 
                    Thousand Weeks introduces readers to tools for constructing a meaningful life by 
                    embracing finitude, showing that many of the unhelpful ways we’ve come to think 
                    about time aren’t inescapable, unchanging truths, but choices we’ve made as 
                    individuals and as a society—and that we can do things differently.

                    existential, issues with a sense of humor and an even-keeled perspective. I found that reading it—Burkeman might balk 
                    at this particular way of describing it—was a good use of my time." —John Williams, The New York Times

                    "This book is wonderful. Instead of offering new tips on how to cram more into your day, it questions why we feel the
                    need to . . . My favorite kind of book is this one—a book that doesn't offer magic solutions to life because there aren't 
                   any. Instead, it examines the human struggle with intelligence, wisdom, humor, and humility . . . Reading this book was 
                   time well spent." —Marianne Power, The Times (UK)

                    "I have long loved Oliver Burkeman's wise and witty journalism that both interrogates and elevates the 'self-help' realm
                    —revealing its possibilities for absurdity while honoring the deeper human impulses that it meets. Four Thousand Weeks
                     is a splendid offering in that spirit. This book is at once sobering and refreshing on all that is truly at stake in what we 
                    blithely refer to as 'time management.' It invites nothing less than a new relationship with time—and with life itself."

                    "A wonderfully honest book, Four Thousand Weeks is a much-needed reality check on our culture's crazy assumptions 
                    around work, productivity and living a meaningful life." —Mark Manson, bestselling author of Everything is F*cked and

                <span>
                    “This is the most important book ever written about time management. Oliver Burkeman offers a searing indictment of 
                    productivity hacking and profound insights on how to make the best use of our scarcest, most precious resource. 
                    His writing will challenge you to rethink many of your beliefs about getting things done—and you’ll be wiser because of it.”

                </span>
                <span>
                    “Four Thousand Weeks is a book to read and re-read, to absorb and reflect on. Compassionate, funny and wise, it has not
                    left my mind since I read it. The modern world teaches us to pretend to be immortal—this book is a dip in the cold, clear 
                   waters of reality, returning us refreshed and alive.” —Naomi Alderman, author of The Power          
                </span>
                <span>
                    “We all know our time is limited. What we don’t know—but what Oliver Burkeman is here to teach us—is that our control 
                    over that time is also limited. This profound (and often hilarious) book will prompt you to rethink your worship of efficiency,
                     reject the cult of busyness, and reconfigure your life around what truly matters.”
                     —Daniel H. Pink, author of When, Drive, and To Sell is Human        
                </span>
                <span>
                    “Oliver Burkeman provides an important and insightful reassessment of productivity. The drive to get more done can become an
                    excuse to avoid figuring out what we actually want to accomplish. Only by confronting this latter question can we unlock a
                    calmer, more meaningful, more resilient approach to organizing our time.” —Cal Newport, New York Times bestselling

                    "Insightful . . . Burkeman’s thoughtful, reassuring analysis will be a welcome balm to readers feeling overwhelmed by the

                        In this insightful work, Burkemen (The Antidote), former psychology columnist for The Guardian, looks at how most people’s efforts 
                        to improve their lives using time efficiently just make things harder. A 4,000-week lifespan, Burkemen laments, is not enough time to 
                        get everything done: if one can accept the fact that “time management as we know it has failed miserably,” one can then enjoy what 
                        can be accomplished in the time one has. Burkeman ruefully illustrates this by describing his own efforts to efficiently read emails, 
                        with the result being simply more emails. He began to question why he worried so much about efficiency, which meant just jamming
                         more into each day. His answer: “We do so because it helps us maintain the feeling of being in omnipotent control of our lives.” 
                        Burkemen’s light philosophical musings point the way to less stressful living, such as his contemplation of “being present” in each
                         moment as a way to control time. He also suggests embracing and setting limits, prioritizing one’s most valued activities, and 
                        accepting “the truth about your finite time” by limiting one’s obligations. Burkemen’s thoughtful, reassuring analysis will be a 
                        welcome balm to readers feeling overwhelmed by the (perhaps unrealistic) demands of life. (Aug.)

                        British journalist Oliver Burkeman’s latest audio is more a contemplative essay than a work of time management advice. The opening 
                        sections move slowly, holding attention because of the relaxed elegance of his speaking voice rather than anything he’s talking about. 
                        But listeners will soon become absorbed with his insight that we worry too much about the roughly 4,000 weeks of time we’re given
                        —how much we achieve, the value of our activities, and the way our past performance and future ambitions pressure us. The 
                        philosophical tone of his delivery is perfect for his thoughtful message: We can enjoy life more if we appreciate the present moment,
                         stay in touch with our deeper selves, and nurture our connections with people and the natural world. T.W. © AudioFile 2021, Portland, Maine
