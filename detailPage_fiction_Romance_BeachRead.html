                    Augustus Everett is an acclaimed author of literary fiction. January Andrews writes 
                    bestselling romance. When she pens a happily ever after, he kills off his entire cast.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    They’re polar opposites. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In fact, the only thing they have in common is that for the next three months, 
                    they're living in neighboring beach houses, broke, and bogged down with writer's 
                    block.        
                </p>
                <p>
                    Until, one hazy evening, one thing leads to another and they strike a deal designed 
                    to force them out of their creative ruts: Augustus will spend the summer writing 
                    something happy, and January will pen the next Great American Novel. She’ll take 
                    him on field trips worthy of any rom-com montage, and he’ll take her to interview 
                    surviving members of a backwoods death cult (obviously). Everyone will finish a 
                    book and no one will fall in love. Really.

                        Henry (Hello Girls) hits all the right notes with this clever, compassionate contemporary romance. January Andrews, a 29-
                        year-old romance author, has always believed in happily-ever-after. Then her father dies and she inherits his secret lake house 
                        in North Bear Shores, Mich., and discovers his long-standing extramarital affair. Broke and suffering from writer’s block, 
                        January’s moves into the “lakeside cottage brimming with charm and proof your father was an asshole and your life has been 
                        a lie.” Her new next-door neighbor is Augustus Everett, the tortured darling of the literary fiction world. Their contentious 
                        front-porch chats lead them to construct a challenge: they’ll each spend the summer writing a novel in the other’s genre, giving 
                        one another tutorials in their respective approaches and going on research trips together. Whoever finishes and sells their book 
                        first, wins. January’s struggle to reconcile her inherent optimism with the recent upheaval in her life is thoroughly convincing 
                        and handled with empathy. Her and Augustus’s path from writing partners to friends to lovers is a constant delight and the 
                        inevitable third act communication issues are deeply rooted in the characters’ psychology, making them believable and fresh. 
                        Readers are sure to fall hard for this meta, heartfelt take on the romance genre. Agent: Taylor Haggerty, Root Literary. (May)

                        “Reader, I swooned! Beach Read is a breath of fresh air. My heart ached for January, and Gus is to die for—a steamy, 
                        smart and perceptive romance. I was engrossed!”—Josie Silver, #1 New York Times bestselling author of One Day in December        
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        “This is a touching and heartfelt book about love, betrayal, grief, failure, and learning how to love again. I adored going 
                        along on Gus and January’s journey, and I closed this book with a satisfied sigh.”
                        —Jasmine Guillory, New York Times Bestselling Author of The Proposal       
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        “Beach Read is original, sparkling bright, and layered with feeling. Has trying to see the world through your long time 
                        crush/rival’s eyes ever been this potent and poignant? If whipcrack banter and foggy sexual tension is your catnip, 
                        you’ll adore this book.”—Sally Thorne, USA Today bestselling author of The Hating Game and 99 Percent Mine           
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        “Beach Read is exactly the witty, charming, and swoony novel we always want; it also happens to be the unexpected wallop 
                        of emotional wisdom and sly social commentary we need right now. I adored it.”—Julia Whelan, author of My Oxford Year           
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        “[It] has everything the title promises—a romping plot, family secrets, and the thrill of falling in love, all set on the sweeping 
                        shores of eastern Lake Michigan. I cannot wait to read what Henry writes next.”
                        —Amy E. Reichert, author The Coincidence of Coconut Cake and The Optimist’s Guide to Letting Go        
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        “Delightfully romantic and slyly poignant, Beach Read is brimming with crackling banter and engrossing prose. It has every 
                        flavor of booklover catnip: rivalry, creative struggle, family secrets, and the sweet head-over-heels tumble into love. Emily 
                        Henry's Beach Read is 2020's perfect anywhere read.”
                        —Christina Lauren, New York Times bestselling author of The Unhoneymooners         
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        “If you liked Sally Thorne’s The Hating Game and Linda Holmes’s Evvie Drake Starts Over, you will definitely be into this, 
                        which feels like their spawn. (No one asked me to say this, by the way. I’m just high on that happy-sad feeling of finishing a 
                        book I enjoyed, that I wish wasn’t over.) Well played.”—Heather Cocks and Jessica Morgan, bestselling authors of The Royal We

                    <span>
                        “This will still sweep readers off their feet. January’s first-person narration is suitably poetic and effervescent, 
                        the small-town beach setting is charming, and the romance is achingly swoony.”—Booklist  
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        “That Henry can manage to both pack a fierce emotional wallop and spear literary posturing in one go is 
                        a testament to her immense skill.”—Entertainment Weekly

                        Two struggling authors spend the summer writing and falling in love in a quaint beach town.
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        January Andrews has just arrived in the small town of North Bear Shores with some serious baggage. 
                        Her father has been dead for a year, but she still hasn’t come to terms with what she found out at his funeral
                        —he had been cheating on her mother for years. January plans to spend the summer cleaning out and selling 
                        the house her father and “That Woman” lived in together. But she’s also a down-on-her-luck author facing 
                        writer’s block, and she no longer believes in the happily-ever-after she’s made the benchmark of her work. 
                        Her steadily dwindling bank account, though, is a daily reminder that she must sell her next book, and fast. 
                        Serendipitously, she discovers that her new next-door neighbor is Augustus Everett, the darling of the literary 
                        fiction set and her former college rival/crush. Gus also happens to be struggling with his next book 
                        (and some serious trauma that unfolds throughout the novel). Though the two get off to a rocky start, they 
                        soon make a bet: Gus will try to write a romance novel, and January will attempt “bleak literary fiction.” 
                        They spend the summer teaching each other the art of their own genres
                        —January takes Gus on a romantic outing to the local carnival; Gus takes January to 
                        the burned-down remains of a former cult—and they both process their own grief, loss, and trauma 
                        through this experiment. There are more than enough steamy scenes to sustain the slow-burn romance, 
                        and smart commentary on the placement and purpose of “women’s fiction” joins with crucial 
                        conversations about mental health to add multiple intriguing layers to the plot.

                        Narrator Julia Whelan inhabits the first-person point of view of January Andrews, a bestselling romance 
                        writer who was a hopeless romantic until her father died and she learned of his mistress. Listeners share 
                        January’s despair as she faces a summer of failing to write her next romance novel while packing up her 
                        father’s secret beach house. She’s dismayed to discover that her grumpy neighbor is her college rival, 
                        Augustus Everett, an acclaimed author of literary fiction. Whelan perfectly captures January’s 
                        defensiveness, which soon gives way to laughter and yearning. She portrays Gus in a deep, gruff voice 
                        suited to his brooding personality. When the authors make a bet to write and sell a book in the other’s 
                        genre, both break through writer’s block and give in to an intense attraction that sparkles on audio.
