                <h3>Notes From Your Bookseller</h3>
                <p>
                    Something sinister is brewing beneath an isolated mansion in the Mexican 
                    countryside, and an ancient evil is about to be exposed. With callbacks to classics 
                    like Rebecca, Jane Eyre and The Haunting of Hill House, Moreno-Garcia proves 
                    that she is just as consumed by stories of haunted houses as we are in this new 
                    gothic horror with a twist.

                    An isolated mansion. A chillingly charismatic aristocrat. And a brave socialite 
                    drawn to expose their treacherous secrets. . . . From the author of Gods of Jade and 
                    Shadow comes “a terrifying twist on classic gothic horror” (Kirkus Reviews) set in

                </p>
                <p>
                    After receiving a frantic letter from her newly-wed cousin begging for someone to 
                    save her from a mysterious doom, Noemí Taboada heads to High Place, a distant 
                    house in the Mexican countryside. She’s not sure what she will find—her cousin’s 
                    husband, a handsome Englishman, is a stranger, and Noemí knows little about the
                     region.       
                </p>
                <p>
                    Noemí is also an unlikely rescuer: She’s a glamorous debutante, and her chic gowns 
                    and perfect red lipstick are more suited for cocktail parties than amateur sleuthing. 
                    But she’s also tough and smart, with an indomitable will, and she is not afraid: Not
                     of her cousin’s new husband, who is both menacing and alluring; not of his father, 
                    the ancient patriarch who seems to be fascinated by Noemí; and not even of the 
                    house itself, which begins to invade Noemi’s dreams with visions of blood and doom.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Her only ally in this inhospitable abode is the family’s youngest son. Shy and gentle, 
                    he seems to want to help Noemí, but might also be hiding dark knowledge of his 
                    family’s past. For there are many secrets behind the walls of High Place. The family’s 
                    once colossal wealth and faded mining empire kept them from prying eyes, but as 
                    Noemí digs deeper she unearths stories of violence and madness.     
                </p>
                <p>
                    And Noemí, mesmerized by the terrifying yet seductive world of High Place, may 
                    soon find it impossible to ever leave this enigmatic house behind.

                    runaway science, carnal passion. But to these she adds a more politically inflected horror, both ancient and timely.”—Los Angeles Times

                        Moreno-Garcia’s energetic romp through the gothic genre (after Gods of Jade and Shadow) is delightfully bonkers. In the 1950s, 
                        Noemí, a flirtatious socialite and college student, travels from Mexico City to rescue her cousin Catalina from the nightmarish High 
                        Place, a remote Mexican mountain villa. Catalina has recently married the chilly, imperiously seductive Virgil Doyle, heir to a now 
                        defunct British silver mining operation. Beset by mysterious fevers, Catalina has written to her uncle, Noemí’s father, telling him, 
                        “This house is sick with rot, stinks of decay, brims with every single evil and cruel sentiment.” Noemí clashes with Virgil’s father, 
                        Howard—who subscribes to theories of eugenics—along with a set of oddly robotic British servants. Beset by horrifying dreams 
                        and visions, and unsettled by a peculiar fungus that grows everywhere, Noemí soon fears for her own life as well as Catalina’s. In a 
                        novel that owes a considerable debt to the nightmarish horror and ornate language of H.P. Lovecraft, the situations in which Noemí 
                        attempts to prevail get wilder and stranger with every chapter, as High Place starts exhibiting a mind of its own, and Noemi learns that 
                        Howard is far older than he appears to be. Readers who find the usual country house mystery too tame and languid won’t have that
                         problem here. (June)

                        When Mexico City debutante Noemí Taboada receives a desperate letter from her newlywed cousin Catalina, she heads to High Plac
                        e manor in the Mexican countryside to investigate. As a socialite accustomed to the best that life in the 1950s has to offer, Noemí is
                         appalled at the state of the isolated property and the deteriorating health of her cousin. When Catalina's English husband, Virgil, and Dr.
                         Cummins, the family physician, answer her inquiries evasively, Noemí befriends Francis, the skittish, outcast youngest son who is 
                        eager to escape his family's legacy. As the clues about the manor's cursed, violent history and its patriarchal powers compound, 
                        Noemí's chances to escape, and rescue her cousin, fade. Do the answers lie within the pulsing walls of the manor, the flora of the 
                        grounds, or the cryptic, coded dreams of its inhabitants? As clarity becomes elusive and hope of outside rescue wanes, Noemí 
                        confronts the predestined, secretive pathos of the family, hoping to rectify its corruption. VERDICT This original, well-paced novel
                         from Moreno-Garcia (Gods of Jade and Shadow) has great gothic elements with a little VanderMeer creativity thrown in. [See Prepub

                        Moreno-Garcia offers a terrifying twist on classic gothic horror, set in 1950s Mexico.

                        Inquisitive 22-year-old socialite and anthropology enthusiast Noemí Taboada adores beautiful clothes and nights on the town in Mexico City with 
                        a bevy of handsome suitors, but her carefree existence is cut short when her father shows her a disturbing letter from her cousin Catalina, who 
                        recently married fair-haired and blue-eyed Virgil Doyle, who comes from a prominent English mining family that built their now-dwindling fortune 
                        on the backs of Indigenous laborers. Catalina lives in High Place, the Doyle family’s crumbling mansion near the former mining town of El Triunfo. 
                        In the letter, Catalina begs for Noemí’s help, claiming that she is “bound, threads like iron through my mind and my skin,” and that High Place 
                        is “sick with rot, stinks of decay, brims with every single evil and cruel sentiment.” Upon Noemí’s arrival at High Place, she’s struck by the Doyle 
                        family’s cool reception of her and their unabashed racism. She's alarmed by the once-vibrant Catalina’s listless state and by the enigmatic Virgil and 
                        his ancient, leering father, Howard. Nightmares, hallucinations, and phantasmagoric dreams of golden dust and fleshy bodies plague Noemí, 
                        and it becomes apparent that the Doyles haven’t left their blood-soaked legacy behind. Luckily, the brave Noemí is no delicate flower, and she’ll 
                        need all her wits about her for the battle ahead. Moreno-Garcia weaves elements of Mexican folklore with themes of decay, sacrifice, and rebirth, 
                        casting a dark spell all the way to the visceral and heart-pounding finale.

                        Fans of gothic classics like Rebecca will be enthralled as long as they don’t mind a heaping dose of all-out horror.
