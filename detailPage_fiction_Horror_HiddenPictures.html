                <p>
                    That fantastic and far-too-rare combination of haunted and humorous, Hidden 
                    Pictures is a unique and satisfying read on multiple levels. It’s a familiar story 
                    (nanny to a boy with strange powers) told in an unfamiliar way, and it will 
                    grip you.

                    From Edgar Award-finalist Jason Rekulak comes a wildly inventive spin on the 
                    supernatural thriller, for fans of Stranger Things and Riley Sager, about a woman 
                    working as a nanny for a young boy with strange and disturbing secrets.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mallory Quinn is fresh out of rehab when she takes a job as a babysitter for Ted 
                    and Caroline Maxwell. She is to look after their five-year-old son, Teddy.        
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mallory immediately loves it. She has her own living space, goes out for nightly 
                    runs, and has the stability she craves. And she sincerely bonds with Teddy, a sweet, 
                    shy boy who is never without his sketchbook and pencil. His drawings are the usual 
                    fare: trees, rabbits, balloons. But one day, he draws something different: a man in a 
                    forest, dragging a woman’s lifeless body.            
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, Teddy’s artwork becomes increasingly sinister, and his stick figures quickly 
                    evolve into lifelike sketches well beyond the ability of any five-year-old. Mallory 
                    begins to wonder if these are glimpses of a long-unsolved murder, perhaps relayed 
                    by a supernatural force.              
                </p>
                <p>
                    Knowing just how crazy it all sounds, Mallory nevertheless sets out to decipher the 
                    images and save Teddy before it’s too late.

                    "It's almost enough to make a person believe in ghosts..." —Kirkus Reviews

                <span>
                    "The explosive third act gives this story a nail-biting ending sure to thrill. Paranormal perfection." —Booklist
                </span>
                <span>
                    “Beautiful, terrifying, and surprisingly kind.”—CrimeReads
                </span>
                <span>
                    "I read Hidden Pictures and loved it. The language is straightforward, the surprises really surprise, and it has that hard-to-
                    achieve propulsiveness that won't let you put it down. And the pictures are terrific!" —Stephen King 
                </span>
                <span>
                    “Whip-smart, creepy as hell, and masterfully plotted, Hidden Pictures is the best new thriller novel I’ve read in years. 
                    Destined to be a classic of the genre.” —Ransom Riggs, bestselling author of Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children  
                </span>
                <span>
                    “Hidden Pictures is one of those rare gems that’s aware of the rules of the genre even as it breaks them and invents new ones. It’s a gas to read, full of wonderful
                    new ideas, both literary and visual. This is one of those books you leave out long after 
                   finishing, just so your friends might see it and give you the chance to share it! Jason Rekulak is going to be telling us all stories for a good long while.” 
                   —Scott Frank, Academy Award-nominated screenwriter and Emmy-winning director of The Queen’s Gambit  
                </span>
                <span>
                    "For a few days, my life was completely hijacked by Jason Rekulak's Hidden Pictures, one of the best and most inventive ghost stories I've read in years. 
                    The damaged but still fighting Mallory Quinn stole my heart and her plunge into supernatural wonder gripped my imagination.
                     It's a beautiful dark rush of a novel. I'm already excited to read it again." —Joe Hill  
                </span>

                    “Hidden Pictures isn’t a ghost story, it’s a scalpel that slices into our smug sense of self-satisfaction so deeply it hits bone. 
                    A perfect summer thriller complete with vengeful spirits, class warfare,and it even has pictures. What more could you want?”

                        Rekulak (The Impossible Fortress) uses horror as a lens to bring the dark underbelly of suburbia into focus in this gripping supernatural thriller. Narrator Mallory
                        Quinn is a 21-year-old recovering addict getting a second chance as a live-in nanny to five-year-old Teddy Maxwell, a sweet-natured young artist whose wonderfully
                        creepy pictures appear throughout the novel. His uncanny muse/model is his “imaginary friend,” Anya, whom his erudite, politically correct parents dismiss. 
                       Mallory takes Anya seriously, however, especially as Teddy’s art rapidly turns darker and impossibly sophisticated and Mallory learns of a long-ago murder in her guest house quarters. 
                       How is Anya manipulating Teddy? Could she be the murder victim? And why do Mallory’s concerns 
                       provoke such explosive emotion in Teddy’s parents? The plot unfolds at a good clip, and Mallory’s voice is engrossing, if occasionally too writerly 
                       for her working-class South Philly roots. There are no shocking twists here, but Rekulak isn’t looking to keep readers up at 
                       night; he’s holding a mirror up to white, affluent Gen X and asking pointed questions about class, trauma, and horror conventions. In that mode, 
                       he executes well and sticks the landing. (May)

                        Recovering addict Mallory Quinn has a new babysitting job with the Maxwells, and she adores their precocious 
                        five-year-old, Teddy. However, she's not a fan of Teddy's imaginary friend Anya, who talks with Teddy during quiet time and makes him draw disturbing pictures of a woman being
                         murdered. Mallory wonders who the woman in the pictures is and what exactly Anya could be. She must find answers if she wants to protect 
                        Teddy and perhaps herself. Rekulak crafts a very solid mystery full of dead ends, red herrings, and a twist that upends expectations. Having the story told by 
                        Mallory, embodied by narrator Suzy Jackson, also really draws listeners into the story. Jackson portrays Mallory as optimistic, resourceful, and someone the audience can 
                        easily root for. Mallory has made mistakes but soon discovers that she is capable. But can she save herself and Teddy? VERDICT Rekulak's (The Impossible Fortress) 
                        latest is both a mystery and a ghost story, with a strong central protagonist.—James Gardner

                        In Rekulak's (The Impossible Fortress) sophomore novel, Mallory becomes the nanny to Teddy, a Philadelphia-area five-year-old possessed by a spirit that 
                        expresses itself by drawing pictures of its murder. Mallory focuses her narration on the inanities of the mother's passive-aggressive nature or  the blandness 
                        of the family's furniture or descriptions of the neighborhood bookstore. But when the boy's wealthy parents refuse to believe that a ghost could be possessing their son0
                        Mallory attempts to communicate with an entity she blithely assumes to be benign. Unfortunately, complications like a cute neighbor and awkward advances from the boy's 
                        father keep Mallory from fully exploring the supernatural puzzle, let alone her wasted athletic career or struggles with addiction. While Mallory eventually 
                        explores her own tragic backstory, it fills a gap more than it drives her character. VERDICT This work offers plenty of commentary about the superficiality and priorities of 
                        upper middle-class America, but a more focused novel would have been more compelling.—Aaron Heil

                        A disturbing household secret has far-reaching consequences in this dark, unusual ghost story.

                        Mallory Quinn, fresh out of rehab and recovering from a recent tragedy, has taken a job as a nanny for an affluent couple living in the upscale suburb of Spring Brook, New Jersey, 
                        when a series of strange events start to make her (and her employers) question her own sanity. Teddy, the precocious and shy 5-year-old boy she's charged with watching, seems 
                        to be haunted by a ghost who channels his body to draw pictures that are far too complex and well formed for such a young child. At first, these drawings are
                         rather typical: rabbits, hot air balloons, trees. But then the illustrations take a dark turn, showcasing the details of a gruesome murder; the inclusion of the drawings,
                         which start out as stick figures and grow increasingly more disturbing and sophisticated, brings the reader right into the story. With the help of an attractive young gardener 
                        and a psychic neighbor and using only the drawings as clues, Mallory must solve the mystery of the house's grizzly past before it's too late. Rekulak does a great job with character
                         development: Mallory, who narrates in the first person, has an engaging voice; the Maxwells' slightly overbearing parenting style and passive-aggressive quips feel 
                        very familiar; and Teddy is so three-dimensional that he sometimes feels like a real child.

                        It's almost enough to make a person believe in ghosts.
