                    Vividly written and exhaustively researched, Jonathan Eig’s King: A Life is the first 
                    major biography in decades of the civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr.—and the 
                    first to include recently declassified FBI files. In this revelatory new portrait of the 
                    preacher and activist who shook the world, the bestselling biographer gives us an 
                    intimate view of the courageous and often emotionally troubled human being who 
                    demanded peaceful protest for his movement but was rarely at peace with himself. 
                    He casts fresh light on the King family’s origins as well as MLK’s complex 
                    relationships with his wife, father, and fellow activists. King reveals a minister 
                    wrestling with his own human frailties and dark moods, a citizen hunted by his own 
                    government, and a man determined to fight for justice even if it proved to be a fight 
                    to the death. As he follows MLK from the classroom to the pulpit to the streets of 
                    Birmingham, Selma, and Memphis, Eig dramatically re-creates the journey of a man 
                    who recast American race relations and became our only modern-day founding 
                    father—as well as the nation’s most mourned martyr.

                <p>
                    In this landmark biography, Eig gives us an MLK for our times: a deep thinker, a 
                    brilliant strategist, and a committed radical who led one of history’s greatest 
                    movements, and whose demands for racial and economic justice remain as urgent 
                    today as they were in his lifetime.

                    Martin Luther King Jr. went beyond meek nonviolence into far-reaching radicalism, according to this sweeping biography. Eig (Ali: A Life)
                    gives a rousing recap of King’s triumphs as a civil rights leader—the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott, his “I Have a Dream” speech at the 
                   1963 march on Washington, the 1965 procession from Selma to Montgomery, Ala.—as well as his despondency later in the 1960s as his 
                   anti-poverty campaigns struggled and Black energies drifted from nonviolent protest toward armed militance and “Black power.” Contesting 
                   accusations by Malcolm X and others that King was an “Uncle Tom,” Eig casts him as a revolutionary who reshaped the South with his 
                   integrationism, became an outspoken opponent of the Vietnam War despite losing political support and drawing the ire of the FBI, and 
                   developed a deep critique of systemic racism and economic inequality that called for reparations for slavery and a guaranteed minimum 
                   income. King is no saint in this complex, nuanced portrait—his plagiarism and womanizing are probed in detail—but Eig’s evocative 
                   prose ably conveys his bravery, charisma, and spell-binding oratory (rallying the Montgomery boycotters, “he called out in his deep, 
                   throbbing voice, and the people responded, the noise of the crowd rolling and pounding in waves that shook the building as he built to
                    a climax”). It’s an enthralling reappraisal that confirms King’s relevance to today’s debates over racial justice. Agent: David Black,

                        Award-winning biographer and journalist Eig (Ali: A Life) turns his lens on the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (1929–68). Mining a trove of
                        materials—many only recently available—augmented with voluminous archival work and hundreds of interviews for personal insights, Eig 
                       advances the already appreciable quantity of first-rate biographies and intensive scholarship on King. He also recovers the man, foibles and 
                       all, from the too often hollowed-out, sainted symbol that competing ideologies have sanitized for national observance. His 45 engrossing 
                       chapters depict King from his enslaved family's history in antebellum Georgia, his stern father's high expectations, and his soothing mother's
                        calm warmth, through his April 1968 assassination in Memphis. The ambitious, anxious, contemplative, depressed, fun-loving, uncertain 
                       private King gets equal attention to the determined, eloquent, fearless public person in the spotlight. From his decrying state-sanctioned and 
                       vigilante violence to his stance against the U.S. war in Vietnam and his Poor People's Campaign, Eig notes it all and paints a thorough picture 
                       of King. VERDICT A must for readers interested in moving beyond clichéd catchphrases to see a more complete and complex King, the context 
                       of his charisma, and the creation and content of his character.—Thomas J. Davis

                        Dion Graham superbly narrates this riveting audiobook, emulating the majestic cadence of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s, speeches. He captures 
                        the Civil Rights leader's deep, resonant tone; deliberate ministerial intonation; and, during offstage moments, his world-weariness. When 
                        portraying Coretta Scott King, Graham modulates his style, and he shifts into reportorial mode, quickening his pace, when delivering historical
                         details of racist violence. Dr. King is rendered as a great but flawed man. The author has made use of recently released tapes and reams of 
                        documents from the FBI; he did hundreds of interviews and had access to other hitherto unseen papers, including the unpublished memoir
                         of Dr. King's father. The result is a monumental biography performed exquisitely by a Golden Voice narrator. A.D.M.

                        Definitive life of the champion of civil rights. 
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        Having placed Muhammad Ali in the canon of civil rights leaders with his 2017 biography, Eig turns to Martin Luther King Jr. (1929-1968) in a
                        monumental biography. He did not begin life with that name: His parents “named him Michael King, no middle name, no initial, no ‘Junior.’
                        They called him Little Mike.” Though small, he was a scrapper on the football field and basketball court, a smart and serious student who 
                       entered Morehouse College early and, having traveled north on a work program and seen the magic of desegregation, became committed to
                        civil rights. The name change, writes the author, “was clinched during a 1934 trip to Germany, where King learned more about the 
                       sixteenth-century German friar.” King first forged the battle for civil rights in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1955; in the 13 years he had left,
                        he galvanized that struggle, carefully planning campaigns while refining his skills by, among other things, visiting India to study the
                        nonviolent tactics of Gandhi. Though King “was a man, not a saint, not a symbol,” he was viewed both positively and negatively as
                        the most important advocate of Black rights—a program he would expand to include an anti–Vietnam War platform and a widening 
                       effort to end poverty worldwide. That spread him thin, but not enough to elude the obsessive hatred of J. Edgar Hoover, who 
                       “saw King as the ultimate disrupter of societal norms.” That he was, even if he was seen as too conservative by some Black militants
                        and too radical by many Whites. Unlike biographers hitherto denied access, Eig examined recently released FBI files to show that there
                        is no evidence that King was a communist operative, as Hoover alleged, though the files do show “the extent and determination of 
                       the bureau’s campaign to thwart King.”
