                    From the critically acclaimed author of Allegedly, Tiffany D. Jackson, comes a 
                    gripping novel about the mystery of one teenage girl’s disappearance and the

                    Monday Charles is missing, and only Claudia seems to notice. Claudia and Monday 
                    have always been inseparable—more sisters than friends. So when Monday doesn’t 
                    turn up for the first day of school, Claudia’s worried.          
                </p>
                <p>
                    When she doesn’t show for the second day, or second week, Claudia knows that 
                    something is wrong. Monday wouldn’t just leave her to endure tests and bullies 
                    alone. Not after last year’s rumors and not with her grades on the line. Now 
                    Claudia needs her best—and only—friend more than ever. But Monday’s mother 
                    refuses to give Claudia a straight answer, and Monday’s sister April is even less help.        
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Claudia digs deeper into her friend’s disappearance, she discovers that no one 
                    seems to remember the last time they saw Monday. How can a teenage girl just 
                    vanish without anyone noticing that she’s gone?

            <div>
                <span>
                    A mesmerizing, punch-in-the-gut story about the power of friendship and the horrors hiding right in front of us.” 
                    — Laurie Halse Anderson, author of Speak and Chains
                </span>
                <span>
                    “This thought-provoking thriller examines issues such as abuse, gentrification, and the marginalization of people of color with nuance 
                    and sensitivity. The narrative deftly moves back and forth between past and present, building to a devastating conclusion. A spellbinding, 
                    profoundly moving choice for YA collections.” — School Library Journal (starred review)          
                </span>
                <span>
                    “Jackson effortlessly weaves elements of suspense with issues of race, class, and gender, casting a harsh light on a world that often refuses to 
                    notice the disappearances of black and brown girls. The twist at the end is both gaspworthy and heartbreaking.” 
                    — Bulletin of the Center for Children’s Books (starred review)      
                </span>
                <span>
                    “Jackson doesn’t hold anything back when it comes to the pain of abuse and the ramifications of turning a blind eye. 
                    It’s a frank, devastating read filled with real and flawed characters, and it’s a story that needs to be read.” — Booklist           
                </span>
                <span>
                    “In addition to a gripping plot line, underlying social issues bubble beneath the surface, such as neighborhood gentrification, 
                    race, poverty, community, the healing of connection, and the destruction in disconnection.” — The Horn Book       
                </span>
                <span>
                    “The gravest, most fundamental challenge in Tiffany D. Jackson’s devastating novel is leveled at a society that purports to value children while 
                    allowing untold numbers of them, particularly poor children and children of color, to fall through the cracks.” — Chicago Tribune
                </span>
                <span>
                    PRAISE FOR ALLEGEDLY: ★ “With remarkable skill, Jackson offers an unflinching portrayal of the raw social outcomes when youth
                    are entrapped in a vicious cycle of nonparenting and are sent spiraling down the prison-for-profit pipeline. Dark, suspenseful.” 
                   — School Library Journal (starred review)      
                </span>
                <span>
                    ★ “Her novel effectively joins Ava DuVernay’s documentary 13th and Michelle Alexander’s The New Jim Crow (2010) to become another
                    indictment of the penal system’s decimating power beyond its bars and, more subtly and refreshingly, a pro-reproductive-justice novel. Searing 
                   and true.” — Kirkus Reviews (starred review)

                <span>
                    ★ “The characters are complex, the situation unsettling, and the line between right and wrong hopelessly blurred. It’s also intensely relevant, 
                    addressing race, age, and mental illness within the criminal justice system. Well conceived and executed, this is an absorbing and exceptional 
                    first novel.” — Publishers Weekly (starred review)

                <span>
                    ★ “Suspenseful without being emotionally manipulative, compelling without resorting to shock value, this is a tightly spun debut that wrestles 
                    with many intense ideas and ends with a knife twist that will send readers racing back to the beginning again.” — Booklist (starred review)

                    “A well-executed, powerful journey into the claustrophobic life of a young girl trying to navigate what little is left after the world has judged her, 
                    and what she will do to escape it.” — Mindy McGinnis, Edgar Award-winning author of A Madness So Discreet

                        The gravest, most fundamental challenge in Tiffany D. Jackson’s devastating novel is leveled at a society that purports 
                        to value children while allowing untold numbers of them, particularly poor children and children of color, to fall through the cracks.

                    <span>
                        In addition to a gripping plot line, underlying social issues bubble beneath the surface, such as neighborhood gentrification, 
                        race, poverty, community, the healing of connection, and the destruction in disconnection.

                        Jackson doesn’t hold anything back when it comes to the pain of abuse and the ramifications of turning a blind eye. 
                        It’s a frank, devastating read filled with real and flawed characters, and it’s a story that needs to be read.

                        Narrator Imani Parks portrays an African-American teen named Claudia who is learning-challenged. At school, Claudia has always been buoyed by her 
                        best friend, Monday Charles, but now, at the beginning of a new school year, Monday is missing, and only Claudia seems to notice. In a story that contains 
                        many time shifts, Parks's emotive narration aids the transitions that recall the closeness of the girls at home and the painful bullying they face at school. At times,
                         Claudia is confused by Monday's increasing anxiety, and Claudia’s frustration turns to fear when even her own usually tender parents 
                        don't seem to listen to her concerns. In each time period, Parks dramatizes the story's building tension. As Claudia pieces together clues, so do listeners. 
                        The surprising climax is poignantly rendered by Parks. S.W. Winner of AudioFile Earphones Award © AudioFile 2018, Portland, Maine
