                <h3>Notes From Your Bookseller</h3>
                <p class="nonunder">
                    A Knives Out-style whodunnit with a twist of Taylor Jenkins Reid, You Must 
                    Remember This is an immersive Gothic mystery, with a long-ago love affair, icy 
                    death, and a rich family gone bad, from Kat Rosenfield, the acclaimed author of No 
                    One Will Miss Her.
                    On Christmas Eve, eighty-five-year-old Miriam Caravasios steps onto the ice that 
                    surrounds her seaside estate on Maine's Mount Desert Island. As a younger woman, 
                    she used to steal out on winter nights to meet her lover, walking across the frozen 
                    reach to their secret meeting place. She knows the way—but not the year. Miriam, 
                    her mind clouded by dementia, doesn’t hear the snap of thin ice until it’s too late.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Was it an accident? Suicide? Or worse: did someone lure the old woman onto the 
                    frozen reach, to her death?          
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are plenty of suspects; Miriam’s fractured and complicated family has 
                    gathered in their Bar Harbor mansion to celebrate what everyone believed would 
                    likely be the matriarch’s last Christmas. The guests include Delphine, Miriam’s 
                    granddaughter, a frightened and insecure young woman who adored her 
                    grandmother, and Miriam’s live-in aide, Adam, whom Delphine has been secretly 
                    dating.  There is Miriam's former housekeeper, Shelly Dyer, who left the family's 
                    employment years ago under mysterious circumstances. There are Miriam’s children: 
                    Theodora, who gave up everything to assume the role of caretaker; Diana, who 
                    seems just a little too eager to inherit her share of the estate; and Richard, whose 
                    longtime grudge against his mother has curdled into gleeful contempt at her 
                    deterioration.            
                </p>
                <p>
                    But it’s Delphine who comes in for the greatest scrutiny when they learn the 
                    shocking news that Miriam’s will cut off her children, leaving her granddaughter 
                    almost everything.           
                </p>
                <p>
                    As tensions rise, Delphine is emboldened to start asking questions: not just about her 
                    grandmother's death, but about her life, and the love story that defined it as the rest 
                    of her memories faded. The trail will take her into the past, into dark places — 
                    vand eventually, onto thin ice.

                    It’s Christmas 2014 in this initially slow moving but ultimately satisfying gothic thriller from Rosenfield (No One Will Miss Her). 
                    The dysfunctional Caravasios clan has gathered at the Whispers, the childhood home in Bar Harbor, Maine, of 85-year-old Miriam 
                    Caravasios, who has dementia and is in a nearby assisted living facility. The house, built by Miriam’s father, who made his fortune in 
                    the 1920s selling bootleg liquor to the Mafia, is a veritable labyrinth of secret passages and hidden chambers. At 19, Miriam married 
                    the dashing Theodore Caravasios, who died in a boating accident a few years later. Miriam now returns to the Whispers in the company 
                    of her private nurse, Adam, for what turns out to be her final meeting with her three adult children and her devoted 26-year-old granddaughter, 
                    Delphine Lockwood. Hopes of inheriting Miriam’s wealth keep her children bickering. When Miriam dies of apparently natural causes, Delphine 
                    wonders whether it might be murder. A subtle shiver of menace runs throughout the narrative, told in part from the point of view of Miriam at 
                    significant points in her life. This thoughtful look at the nature of memories will resonate with many readers. Agent: Yfat Reiss Gendell, YRG

                        Washington Post on No One Will Miss Her
                        Countless thrillers have patterned themselves on Gone Girl in the decade since Gillian Flynn transfixed readers and transformed the literary landscape; 
                        rare is the suspense novel that summons the same dark magic even as it twists itself into a bold new shape. No One Will Miss Her is just such a book: 
                        blade-sharp, whip-smart, and genuinely original—a thriller to refresh your faith in the genre, your belief that a story can still outpace and outsmart you."

                        Family secrets and personal histories are unveiled in chapters that alternate between the 1940s and 2014 in Rosenfield's latest (after No One Will Miss 
                        Her). Despite being estranged, the adult children and granddaughter of Mimi Caravasios gather at her rundown mansion in Maine for what could be 
                        the last time. When the body of Mimi, who was suffering from dementia, is discovered under the ice in the bay on Christmas Day, her granddaughter, 
                        Del, questions whether the death was accidental, suicide, or murder. Suspects abound: Uncle Richard, the family black sheep; Aunt Diana and her boring 
                        husband, who are deep in debt; darkly brooding Jack Dyer, the family nanny; Delphine's mother, Theodora, who was Mimi's main caretaker. Rosenfield 
                        provides plenty of twists and turns to keep readers guessing in this atmospheric mystery where all the characters had motive and means to commit murder, 
                        especially for the millions of dollars that Mimi's estate is worth. VERDICT Fans of Agatha Christie will love the red herrings and large cast of interesting 
                        characters. Recommended for most libraries; large libraries or those with large numbers of mystery readers may need multiple copies.—Terri Lent
