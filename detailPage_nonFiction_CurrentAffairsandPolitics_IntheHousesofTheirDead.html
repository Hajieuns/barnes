                <p class="bold nonunder">
                    “Here is Lincoln in the Bardo—for real. You couldn’t make it up—necromancers, 
                    mad actors, frauds, true believers, and, in the middle, the greatest President.” 
                    —Sidney Blumenthal, author of The Political Life of Abraham Lincoln 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The story of Abraham Lincoln as it has never been told before: through the strange, 
                    even otherworldly, points of contact between his family and that of the man who 
                    killed him, John Wilkes Booth.
                    In the 1820s, two families, unknown to each other, worked on farms in the 
                    American wilderness. It seemed unlikely that the families would ever meet—and yet, 
                    they did. The son of one family, the famed actor John Wilkes Booth, killed the son 
                    of the other, President Abraham Lincoln, in the most significant assassination in 
                    American history. The murder, however, did not come without warning—in fact, it 
                    had been foretold.            
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the Houses of Their Dead is the first book of the many thousands written about 
                    Lincoln to focus on the president’s fascination with Spiritualism, and to demonstrate 
                    how it linked him, uncannily, to the man who would kill him. Abraham Lincoln is 
                    usually seen as a rational, empirically-minded man, yet as acclaimed scholar and 
                    biographer Terry Alford reveals, he was also deeply superstitious and drawn to the 
                    irrational. Like millions of other Americans, including the Booths, Lincoln and his 
                    wife, Mary, suffered repeated personal tragedies, and turned for solace to 
                    Spiritualism, a new practice sweeping the nation that held that the dead were nearby 
                    and could be contacted by the living. Remarkably, the Lincolns and the Booths even 
                    used the same mediums, including Charles Colchester, a specialist in “blood writing” 
                    whom Mary first brought to her husband, and who warned the president after 
                    listening to the ravings of another of his clients, John Wilkes Booth.

                <p>
                    Alford’s expansive, richly-textured chronicle follows the two families across the 
                    nineteenth century, uncovering new facts and stories about Abraham and Mary 
                    while drawing indelible portraits of the Booths—from patriarch Julius, a famous 
                    actor in his own right, to brother Edwin, the most talented member of the family 
                    and a man who feared peacock feathers, to their confidant Adam Badeau, who 
                    would become, strangely, the ghostwriter for President Ulysses S. Grant. At every 
                    turn, Alford shows that despite the progress of the age—the glass hypodermic 
                    syringe, electromagnetic induction, and much more—death remained ever-present, 
                    and thus it was only rational for millions of Americans, from the president on down, 
                    to cling to beliefs that seem anything but. A novelistic narrative of two exceptional 
                    American families set against the convulsions their times, In the Houses of Their 
                    Dead ultimately leads us to consider how ghost stories helped shape the nation.

                    In this intriguing if meandering study, historian Alford (Fortune’s Fool) views the “common experiences” of the Lincoln and Booth families through
                    the lens of spiritualism. He details how Mary Todd Lincoln became interested in spiritualism after the death of the couple’s second child, Eddie, in 
                   1850. When another son, Willie, died in 1862, Mary’s interest intensified, and the Lincolns sat for about a dozen seances with medium Nettie Colburn
                    in a two-year period at the White House. Though Abraham Lincoln was “embarrassingly superstitious,” according to Alford, he viewed spiritualism 
                   largely as “entertainment,” whereas Mary “seemed to summon , bringing herself into a trance state just like a medium.” Elsewhere, Alford links the 
                   Booth family’s interest in spiritualism and the occult to patriarch Junius Brutus Booth, a talented but alcoholic and mentally unstable actor given to 
                   periodic breakdowns. During the Civil War, the Lincolns and Booths consulted the same mediums, including Englishman Charles Colchester (real 
                   name Jackson Sealby), who grew so alarmed by John Wilkes Booth’s threats against the president that he gave Lincoln “vague but repeated warnings 
                   to take care.” Though Alford occasionally wanders far afield from the book’s central theme, he packs the narrative with intriguing if little-known 
                   historical figures and strange coincidences. This unusual portrait of two famously intertwined families fascinates. (June)

                        "Absorbing... Alford does a fine job of describing the Booths and their circle... Alford’s revelation of this and other connections between the Booths 
                        and the Lincolns is what distinguishes In the Houses of Their Dead from previous studies of spiritualism in the Lincoln White House... Alford ranges 
                        widely into the personal backgrounds of Lincoln and the Booth family, opening new vistas on both. His book is made up of many interwoven threads
                        —neglected biographical facts, events of the Civil War, and acting styles—connected in varied ways to superstition or the afterlife... Alford’s portrayal 
                        of John Wilkes Booth is interestingly complex... [and] gives vivid accounts of the murder in Ford’s Theatre and the manhunt for Booth."

                        Historian Alford (Fortune's Fool) brings an ingenious twist to the well-known tale of Abraham Lincoln and John Wilkes Booth. Alford adds details
                        and corrects common misconceptions about their lives as the story works toward its inevitable conclusion. With the six degrees of separation theory 
                       in hand, the author points out every point where the lives of these two families intersected in the young and divided United States. Narrator Danny
                        Campbell puts his experience and expertise to good use. His even, authoritative tone delivers the facts clearly, aiding in their absorption. This is 
                       especially important given the multitude of time lines being followed from beginning to end. One of the main themes throughout the book is the 
                       abundance and popularity of spiritualists and the spiritualism movement of this era. The Booths and Lincolns consulted many and had some in 
                       common. Life was precarious even without a civil war, and the living wanted to maintain their connections to their dearly departed. VERDICT 
                       Listeners will appreciate the clarity of voice Campbell executes, helping them keep it all straight and enhancing those moments they may not
                        have known about before.—Laura Trombley

                        A tale of two historically prominent families who shared a fascination with spiritualism.   
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        That John Wilkes Booth killed Abraham Lincoln on April 14, 1865, is universally known, but no member of either family had met until that day
                        —despite the fact that two Booth brothers and their father were nationally known actors and the Lincolns had attended their performances.
                         Historian Alford cuts back and forth among the lives of Abraham and Mary Lincoln and Junius Booth and his sons Edwin and John Wilkes
                         without ignoring lesser-known members of both families. Faithful to his theme, Alford reminds readers that 19th-century America was rife
                         with superstition, and all of his subjects possessed elements of the true believer. Lincoln, for example, “refused to become the thirteenth 
                        person at a table once,” and the deaths of spouses and children were a common obsession. “Quasi-religious in nature,” writes Alford, 
                        “spiritualism held that the dead were nearby.” Skeptics abounded, and everyone agreed that many mediums were charlatans, but believers 
                        had no doubt that some could summon the dead. Although a skeptic about some aspects of spiritualism, Lincoln attended séances and 
                        sometimes praised the mediums, but he did not take them seriously. This was definitely not the case with his wife, Mary, devastated by
                         the deaths of two children, her husband, and then another child; she remained a devoted spiritualist to her dying day. With a father and
                         three sons on the stage, the Booths were no strangers to torment, mental illness, and personal tragedy, and they indulged in anything that
                         might relieve their misery—although alcohol competed effectively with the occult. In the end, spiritualism contributed little to American 
                        politics of the time or even to theatrical history, but it preoccupied a good portion of the population. Nonetheless, even history buffs will 
                        find new information in Alford’s sympathetic examination.
