                    In the midst of the impeachment crisis of 2019, Heather Cox Richardson launched a 
                    daily Facebook essay providing the historical background of the daily torrent of 
                    news. It soon turned into a newsletter and its readership ballooned to more than 2

                </p>
                <p>
                    In Democracy Awakening, Richardson crafts a compelling and original narrative, 
                    explaining how, over the decades, a small group of wealthy people have made war 
                    on American ideals. By weaponizing language and promoting false history they have 
                    led us into authoritarianism — creating a disaffected population and then promising 
                    to recreate an imagined past where those people could feel important again. She 
                    argues that taking our country back starts by remembering the elements of the 
                    nation’s true history that marginalized Americans have always upheld. Their 
                    dedication to the principles on which this nation was founded has enabled us to 
                    renew and expand our commitment to democracy in the past. Richardson sees this 
                    history as a roadmap for the nation’s future.             
                </p>
                <p>
                    Richardson’s talent is to wrangle our giant, meandering, and confusing news feed 
                    into a coherent story that singles out what we should pay attention to, what the 
                    precedents are, and what possible paths lie ahead. In her trademark calm prose, she 
                    is realistic and optimistic about the future of democracy. Her command of history 
                    allows her to pivot effortlessly from the Founders to the abolitionists to 
                    Reconstruction to Goldwater to Mitch McConnell, highlighting the political legacies 
                    of the New Deal, the lingering fears of socialism, the death of the liberal consensus 
                    and birth of “movement conservatism.”

                    Many books tell us what has happened over the last five years. Democracy 
                    Awakening explains how we got to this perilous point, what our history really tells 
                    us about ourselves, and what the future of democracy can be.

                <span>
                    In this muddled survey, Boston College historian Richardson (To Make Men Free) analyzes the history of the United States from its origins 
                    through the present day, reframing many of the nation’s major internal conflicts as part of an ongoing clash between “liberal democracy” 
                    and emerging “authoritarianism.” Richardson touches briefly on such events as the Civil War, the political fight over the New Deal, and 
                    the civil rights movement, arguing that these were moments when authoritarianism was thwarted by defenders of democracy who drew 
                    political strength from the liberal Enlightenment-era principles in the country’s founding documents. But according to Richardson, from 
                    the 1950s onward authoritarianism has been on the rise (she cites McCarthyism and the Reagan administration as big steps in that 
                    direction), culminating with the election of Donald Trump. At one point, Richardson acknowledges that her argument amounts to a 
                    relabeling of “conservativism” as “authoritarianism”: She explains that political opponents of the New Deal, who rallied behind a 
                    document called “The Conservative Manifesto” in the 1930s, were misappropriating the label “conservative” (which should only be 
                    fairly used, Richardson asserts, as a term for people who oppose something “radical”—which, the reader is left to assume, the New 
                    Deal wasn’t), and thus all political conservatives since have also been mislabeled. Meanwhile, she never convincingly justifies the use
                     of the term “authoritarianism” to refer to, for example, political opponents of civil rights for African Americans. Readers will be 
                    perplexed. (Sept.)

                        [Democracy Awakening] is the most lucid just-so story for Trump’s rise I’ve ever heard. It’s magisterial.”

                        characterized as America’s Third Reconstruction…she is at her best simply telling us the story of how we came to be living on the brink 
                       of ending our nearly 250-year democratic experiment.”

                        its own best ideals. From yesterday's enslavers to today's authoritarians, it shows how bad actors have always tried to twist history to 
                        serve their own purposes, but again and again, less powerful challengers have risen and often won. It's both a cause for hope, and a call to arms.”

                        forces that an elite minority has fostered to divide Americans, erode democracy, and rise to power. By reclaiming this history, she reminds 
                       us that democracy is a process, not an endpoint — and that it demands our efforts now, more than ever.”

                        current political crisis against the age-old struggle to expand civil rights and economic opportunity. What emerges is a brilliant and honest 
                        account of our nation’s past and present. If you care about American democracy—and are engaged in the fight to preserve it—this book is a must-read.”

                        Since its birth, the U.S. has been caught between two competing schools of thought, one tending toward authoritarianism and the other
                        seeking to widen its embrace of pluralism. So argues Richardson, a professor of U.S. history, author of How the South Won the Civil War, 
                       and creator of the popular Substack newsletter “Letters From an American.” “America is at a crossroads,” she writes. “A country that 
                       once stood as the global symbol of democracy has been teetering on the brink of authoritarianism. How did this happen?” In the calm, 
                       deliberate prose her newsletter readers will recognize, Richardson traces the rise of the modern right wing from the 1930s, finding its 
                       roots in a New Deal–era rejection of governmental intervention. It struggled against the post–World War II liberal consensus but gained 
                       ground with Nixon’s Southern Strategy and culminated in Trumpism. The author devotes 10 chapters to the Trump presidency, which 
                       she calls “the authoritarian experiment.” Her summary of the excesses of the era is laid out with her trademark combination of passion 
                       and restraint, the explicit comparisons to European fascism bolstered, horrifyingly, by Mein Kampf, among other voices from both past
                        and present. However, Richardson doesn’t end with the wreckage left by Trump. Following a dismal recap of the 2021-2022 Supreme 
                       Court session, she takes readers back to the nation’s founding, writing about the emergence of our imperfect union and its halting 
                       expansion of rights. Never losing sight of the fact that it was “those excluded from an equal seat at the table [who] would redefine what
                        it meant to be an American, keeping a dream of human equality alive,” the author escorts readers to the modern era. It’s an unusual but
                        effective structure, allowing Richardson to do what she does best: show her readers how history and the present are in constant conversation.

                        Political historian Heather Cox Richardson, who is unabashedly pro-democracy and anti-authoritarianism, and known to many from her daily 
                        "Letters from an American" newsletter, narrates with energy and a clear, well-paced style. Her performance complements the hallmark way 
                        she lays out historical facts. In this book she describes how American democracy has been shaped from its birth through the authoritarianism 
                        of the Trump administration and President Biden's attempt to right the ship of state. Richardson's appealing voice, adept nonfiction cadence,
                         and understated presentation propel the text, making it easy for listeners to appreciate the many facts and dates that range from 
                        1776 to 2023. At the end, Richardson reminds us that democracy is ultimately in our hands. S.G. © AudioFile 2023, Portland, Maine
