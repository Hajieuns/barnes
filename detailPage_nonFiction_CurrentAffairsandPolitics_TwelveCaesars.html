                <h3>Notes From Your Bookseller</h3>
                <p>
                    A sumptuously illustrated, beautifully designed, gloriously rich work of history from 
                    the distinguished classicist with a lively literary voice, an extraordinary eye for 
                    telling detail, and a grand sense of humor. Twelve Caesars is a masterful, brilliant 
                    work of detection, a joy to read.      
                </p>
                <p class="bold">
                    From the bestselling author of SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome, the fascinating 
                    story of how images of Roman autocrats have influenced art, culture, and the 
                    representation of power for more than 2,000 years       
                </p>
                <p>
                    What does the face of power look like? Who gets commemorated in art and why? 
                    And how do we react to statues of politicians we deplore? In this book—against a 
                    background of today’s “sculpture wars”—Mary Beard tells the story of how for 
                    more than two millennia portraits of the rich, powerful, and famous in the western 
                    world have been shaped by the image of Roman emperors, especially the “Twelve 
                    Caesars,” from the ruthless Julius Caesar to the fly-torturing Domitian. Twelve 
                    Caesars asks why these murderous autocrats have loomed so large in art from 
                    antiquity and the Renaissance to today, when hapless leaders are still caricatured as 
                    Neros fiddling while Rome burns.           
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beginning with the importance of imperial portraits in Roman politics, this richly 
                    illustrated book offers a tour through 2,000 years of art and cultural history, 
                    presenting a fresh look at works by artists from Memling and Mantegna to the 
                    nineteenth-century American sculptor Edmonia Lewis, as well as by generations of 
                    weavers, cabinetmakers, silversmiths, printers, and ceramicists. Rather than a story 
                    of a simple repetition of stable, blandly conservative images of imperial men and 
                    women, Twelve Caesars is an unexpected tale of changing identities, clueless or 
                    deliberate misidentifications, fakes, and often ambivalent representations of 
                    authority.         
                </p>
                <p>
                    From Beard’s reconstruction of Titian’s extraordinary lost Room of the Emperors to 
                    her reinterpretation of Henry VIII’s famous Caesarian tapestries, Twelve Caesars 
                    includes fascinating detective work and offers a gripping story of some of the most 
                    challenging and disturbing portraits of power ever created.

                        Images of Roman emperors have been emblems for centuries, even as they change in meaning and medium throughout time, from 
                        sculptures to coins to tapestries to paintings. Classicist Beard (Univ. of Cambridge; SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome) argues, 
                        with characteristic incisive prose and wit, that we can learn much about an era from its images of the central "Twelve Caesars" 
                        and the way they were used and understood at that time (despite disagreement on that canon of caesars). She also argues that in 
                        spite of the evolution of the Twelve Caesars in image and concept, some aspects of the narrative never changed. Beard explains 
                        that wishful thinking and misreadings of Latin abound in establishing the identities and provenances of artworks and antiquities 
                        depicting Roman emperors. When the symbolism of a portrait would seem to go against the ideological tenor of its era, Beard
                         cuts through scholarly speculation; she points out that anachronism might result from simple misidentification or the prosaic 
                        decorative and acquisitive aspects of collecting imperial images. Assembling a full set of caesars was, and is, a common pursuit 
                        of collectors, Beard writes, and for rich and powerful collectors, it was all the better if the portraits tied their owner's legacy to
                         the continuity of Roman power. Extensive illustrations of emperors and their likenesses are featured throughout the book. 
                        VERDICT Based on a series of Beard's lectures, this lavishly illustrated volume will be accessible and interesting to a wide 
                        variety of readers; a must-read for anyone interested in classics or art history—Margaret Heller, Loyola Univ. Chicago Libs.

                        The renowned classicist and bestselling author of SPQR (2015) considers Rome’s first rulers as they have come down to us in marble, 
                        stone, coins, and metals.          
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        During the time of the Roman Empire, artists churned out an avalanche of portraits of Rome’s emperors, a trend that continued after 
                        their deaths, beyond the fall of the empire, and during the centuries following up to the modern age. Suetonius’ The Twelve Caesars,
                         which later became one of “the most popular history books of the European Renaissance,” contains the only surviving physical 
                        descriptions. Many modern historians, however, consider his stories “the gossip of the palace corridors, or even outright fantasy, 
                        but…they have become inextricably part of our view of Roman emperors.” No statue from ancient times has a label; this is not
                         the case with innumerable Roman coins minted during their reigns, but the tiny heads are little help. Beard points out that 
                        beginning in the Renaissance, rulers and wealthy patrons not only collected images of emperors and their consorts—or, more
                         likely, a copy, fake, or image of someone else—but they also began portraying themselves as if they were Roman. A leading 
                        scholar as well as a writer of bestsellers, Beard, as always, asks important questions: What did the Caesars look like? Did the
                         artists themselves care? Why did European plutocrats, aristocrats, and monarchs like to see themselves in togas? She leads us
                         through the best available evidence (even if it’s not always satisfying) and delivers insightful answers in lucid prose accompanied 
                        by dazzling images. Along with a steady stream of commentary on portraits, sculptures, and prints, the author devotes long 
                        sections to artistic masterpieces, including tapestries, murals, enormous historical paintings, and Titian’s spectacular room of
                         the Caesars (11 of them, not Suetonius’ 12), now lost.
