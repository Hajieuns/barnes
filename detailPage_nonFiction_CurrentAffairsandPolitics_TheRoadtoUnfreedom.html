                    NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • From the author of On Tyranny comes a

                    With the end of the Cold War, the victory of liberal democracy seemed final. 
                    Observers declared the end of history, confident in a peaceful, globalized future. 
                    This faith was misplaced. Authoritarianism returned to Russia, as Vladimir Putin 
                    found fascist ideas that could be used to justify rule by the wealthy. In the 2010s, it 
                    has spread from east to west, aided by Russian warfare in Ukraine and cyberwar in 
                    Europe and the United States.       
                </p>
                <p>
                    Russia found allies among nationalists, oligarchs, and radicals everywhere, and its 
                    drive to dissolve Western institutions, states, and values found resonance within the 
                    West itself.  The rise of populism, the British vote against the EU, and the election of 
                    Donald Trump were all Russian goals, but their achievement reveals the vulnerability 
                    of Western societies.        
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this forceful and unsparing work of contemporary history, based on vast research 
                    as well as personal reporting, Snyder goes beyond the headlines to expose the true 
                    nature of the threat to democracy and law. To understand the challenge is to see, 
                    and perhaps renew, the fundamental political virtues offered by tradition and 
                    demanded by the future. By revealing the stark choices before us—between equality 
                    or oligarchy, individuality or totality, truth and falsehood—Snyder restores our 
                    understanding of the basis of our way of life, offering a way forward in a time of 
                    terrible uncertainty.

                    voice, this relatively short book covers a vast canvas. . . . A roller-coaster world calls for a news editor’s skill in processing facts and
                     a philosopher’s ability to dissect ideologies. Snyder has both.” —The Economist

                    the United States has already traveled to the sinister destination in Snyder’s title. If some of Snyder’s assessment seems overstated or 
                    premature, he can powerfully reply: He has perceived more accurately than his critics what has already happened. He has earned the

                     power and fake news spread from Russia into Ukraine, Western Europe and now to the White House. At a time when the politics of 
                    apocalypse haunt American democracy, Snyder helps unpack how we got here—and, maybe, how we can get out.” —Lucas Wittmann, TIME                
                </span>
                <span>
                    "Snyder’s horror at what has happened in Russia—and at the risks to the US and Europe—gives his writing energy and passion. He is 
                    unsparing in his indictment of Putin’s Russia. . . .But he is also clear-eyed about the weaknesses of American society that have made the 
                    US vulnerable to Russian intervention and domestic populism." —Gideon Rachman, The Financial Times            
                </span>

                <span>
                    “Of all the books that seek to explain the current crisis of Western liberal democracy, none is more eloquent or frightening than Snyder’s 
                    The Road to Unfreedom.” —Foreign Affairs

                <span>
                    “Brilliant. . . . Bleak and eloquent. . . . Snyder’s account of the Trump ascendancy, and the many helping hands given from Russia, is 
                    vividly and insightfully told.” —Edward Lucas, The Times (London)

                    “A slim book that fits alongside your pocket Constitution and feels only slightly less vital. . . . Grounded in history yet imbued with
                    the fierce urgency of what now.” —Carlos Lozada, The Washington Post            
                </span>
                <span>
                    “Snyder reasons with unparalleled clarity, throwing the past and future into sharp relief. He has written the rare kind of book that 
                    can be read in one sitting but will keep you coming back to help regain your bearings.” —Masha Gessen, author of The Future Is History

                <span>
                    “As Timothy Snyder explains in his fine and frightening On Tyranny, a minority party now has near-total power and is therefore
                    understandably frightened of awakening the actual will of the people.” —Adam Gopnik, The New Yorker         
                </span>
                <span>
                    “Snyder knows this subject cold. . . . It is impossible to read aphorisms like ‘post-truth is pre-fascism’ and not feel a small chill about 
                    the current state of the Republic.” —Daniel W. Drezner, The New York Times Book Review            
                </span>
                <span>
                    “Snyder draws an unbroken line between the darkest events and personalities of the past and the ones that confront us in the here and
                    now. . . . As he did in On Tyranny, Snyder argues that we are facing a challenge of potentially catastrophic proportions, but he refuses
                    to despair.” –Jonathan Kirsch, Jewish Journal

                        We are living in dangerous times, Timothy Snyder argues forcefully and eloquently in his new book, The Road to Unfreedom. Too many of
                        us, leaders and followers, are irresponsible, rejecting ideas that don't fit our preconceptions, refusing discussion and rejecting compromise. 
                       Worse, we are prepared to deny the humanity and rights of others…The Road to Unfreedom is a good wake-up call. You don't have to 
                       agree with all of Snyder's conclusions, but he is right that understanding is empowerment.

                        Yale history professor Snyder (On Tyranny) buttresses his denunciation of Donald Trump as a nascent authoritarian with a fascinating, 
                        detailed exploration of how recent events in Russia presaged Trump’s administration. Beginning by discussing the obscure early-20th-century 
                        Russian philosopher Ivan Ilyin, who regarded “fascism as the politics of the world to come,” Snyder traces Ilyin’s influence on Vladimir Putin’s
                         aggressive efforts to return his country to superpower status. Those included the 2014 invasion of Ukraine, which Snyder considers “the warning 
                        that went unheeded” of Russia’s willingness to interfere with other countries’ political systems, as later seen during the 2016 U.S. presidential
                         election. He relates Ilyin’s belief that strong rulers favor self-serving myths over empirical evidence to numerous examples of the Putin regime’s 
                        propaganda. In perhaps its most audacious PR coup, Russia’s downing of a Malaysia Airlines flight over Ukraine was spun so successfully that
                         well over 80% of Russians believed their country wasn’t to blame. This instance of “alternative facts” will resonate with many Trump opponents, 
                        as will Snyder’s dissection of the leadership style of oligarchs, both Russian and American. His work achieves its stated goal of conveying the
                         relationship among “interconnected events in our own contemporary world history” and will be a must-read for those concerned about 
                        democracy’s safety in the 21st century. Agent: Tina Bennett, WME. (Apr.)

                        Celebrated for books such as On Tyranny and Bloodlands, the multi-award-winning Snyder builds on his considerable knowledge of Eastern 
                        Europe and the Holocaust to explore the return of authoritarianism today, starting with Vladimir Putin's consolidation of power in Russia. 
                        Since then, as he chronicles here, authoritarian tendencies have moved west to Poland and Hungary and have cast a shadow on recent events 
                        in the United States and the UK, where deep-seated liberal values are being challenged. Especially relevant as President Trump's ties to 
                        Russia are more closely examined.

                        How Russia's campaign to undermine democracies threatens the European Union and the United States.In a hard-hitting analysis of current events,
                        Snyder (History/Yale Univ.; On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century, 2017, etc.) argues persuasively that Russia under is aggressively 
                       working to destabilize Western nations and export "massive inequality" and "the displacement of policy by propaganda." Beginning with the strenuous
                        revival of totalitarian thought in 2011, Russia has widened its efforts to attack the EU and to infiltrate American politics by masterminding the election
                        of Donald Trump. For Russia, the EU, which requires that its member countries are democratic and promote human rights, exists as an affront to 
                       its "native kleptocracy." Because "Russian state power could not increase, nor Russian technology close the gap with Europe and America," writes 
                       the author, it sought to gain "relative power" by weakening other nations. Using targeted Twitter campaigns, trolls, and bots, Russia manipulated a
                        "lLeave" vote in the Brexit referendum and later directed its attention to working against Emmanuel Macron in France and Angela Merkel in
                        Germany. Snyder chronicles Putin's successful influence in Trump's nomination and election: "a cyberwar to destroy the United States of America.
                       " Russian connections to Trump began in the 1990s, when Russian gangsters laundered money by buying and selling apartments in Trump Tower.
                        Trump, who at the time was bankrupt and owed about $4 billion to more than 70 banks, welcomed funds from Russian oligarchs, who bought his 
                       properties through shell companies. The author expertly details Russian involvement in the 2016 election by Paul Manafort, who "had experience 
                       getting Russia's preferred candidates elected president"; Trump's foreign policy adviser, pro-Putin Carter Page, who became a lobbyist for Russian gas 
                       companies; and Michael Flynn. Russian use of Twitter, Facebook, and other internet sources "exploited American gullibility" and cynicism. Freedom, 
                       Snyder writes, "depends upon citizens who are able to make a distinction between what is true and what they want to hear."A highly distressing, 
                       urgent alarm to awaken Americans to the peril of authoritarianism.
