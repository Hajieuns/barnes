                    Brilliant and engagingly written, Why Nations Fail answers the question that has 
                    stumped the experts for centuries: Why are some nations rich and others poor, 
                    divided by wealth and poverty, health and sickness, food and famine? 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Is it culture, the weather, geography? Perhaps ignorance of what the right policies 
                    are?        
                </p>
                <p>
                    Simply, no. None of these factors is either definitive or destiny. Otherwise, how to 
                    explain why Botswana has become one of the fastest growing countries in the world, 
                    while other African nations, such as Zimbabwe, the Congo, and Sierra Leone, are 
                    mired in poverty and violence?      
                </p>
                <p>
                    Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson conclusively show that it is man-made 
                    political and economic institutions that underlie economic success (or lack of it). 
                    Korea, to take just one of their fascinating examples, is a remarkably homogeneous 
                    nation, yet the people of North Korea are among the poorest on earth while their 
                    brothers and sisters in South Korea are among the richest. The south forged a society 
                    that created incentives, rewarded innovation, and allowed everyone to participate in 
                    economic opportunities.         
                </p>
                <p>
                    The economic success thus spurred was sustained because the government became 
                    accountable and responsive to citizens and the great mass of people. Sadly, the 
                    people of the north have endured decades of famine, political repression, and very 
                    different economic institutions—with no end in sight. The differences between the 
                    Koreas is due to the politics that created these completely different institutional 
                    trajectories.       
                </p>

                    Based on fifteen years of original research Acemoglu and Robinson marshall 
                    extraordinary historical evidence from the Roman Empire, the Mayan city-states, 
                    medieval Venice, the Soviet Union, Latin America, England, Europe, the United 
                    States, and Africa to build a new theory of political economy with great relevance for 
                    the big questions of today, including:          
                </p>
                <p>
                    - China has built an authoritarian growth machine. Will it continue to grow at such 
                    high speed and overwhelm the West?          
                </p>
                <p>
                    - Are America’s best days behind it? Are we moving from a virtuous circle in which 
                    efforts by elites to aggrandize power are resisted to a vicious one that enriches and 
                    empowers a small minority?       
                </p>
                <p>
                    - What is the most effective way to help move billions of people from the rut of 
                    poverty to prosperity? More philanthropy from the wealthy nations of the West? Or 
                    learning the hard-won lessons of Acemoglu and Robinson’s breakthrough ideas on 
                    the interplay between inclusive political and economic institutions?

                    eventual decay or stagnation. Somehow they can generate both excitement and reflection.” —Robert Solow, Nobel Laureate in Economics, 1987

                        Coauthors Acemoglu (economics, MIT) and Robinson (David Florence Professor of Government, Harvard Univ.) won high praise for their 
                        previous collaboration, Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy, an examination of what influences democracy to take root, persist, 
                        or collapse. They have tackled an equally important and difficult topic in their latest effort in seeking to explain what causes countries to be 
                        rich or poor. In their opinion, neither climate, geography, nor culture paves or blocks the way to prosperity—institutions do. To illustrate their
                         point, the authors use diverse examples from world history, e.g., the Mayan city-states of 250–900 C.E., the Glorious Revolution of 1688, 
                        and the Egyptian uprising that brought down Hosni Mubarak in 2011. VERDICT The authors make what could be a weighty topic both 
                        engaging and accessible. It will appeal not only to students of economics and political science but also to anyone looking to gain insight into 
                        the current state of our global economy, its origins, and the kind of transformations that might level the playing field.

                        The authors offer a comprehensive institutional theory for the wealth and poverty of nations, extolling “inclusive institutions” as the sources of 
                        prosperity and stability and “extractive institutions” as the sources of poverty and nation failure. England's “Glorious Revolution” of 1688 
                        becomes the yardstick with which to measure the development of inclusive institutions around the world. Dan Woren’s deep, resonant voice 
                        effectively presents the authors’ sometimes complex political observations. His narration is measured and clear. As will happen when a book
                         draws examples from around the world, Woren’s pronunciation sometimes leaves something to be desired. For example, the phrase “ancien 
                        régime” and the names of Communist Chinese officials create problems. F.C. © AudioFile 2012, Portland, Maine

                        Following up on their earlier collaboration (Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy, 2005), two scholars examine why some nations
                        thrive and others don't. Neither geography, nor culture, nor mistaken policies explain the vast differences in prosperity among nations. 
                       The reasons for world inequality, write Acemoglu (Economics/MIT) and Robinson (Government/Harvard Univ.), are rooted in politics, in 
                       whether nations have developed inclusive political institutions and a sufficiently centralized state to lay the groundwork for economic 
                       institutions critical for growth. In turn, these economic institutions give citizens liberty to pursue work that suits their talents, a 
                       fairly enforced set of rules and incentives to pursue education and technological innovation. When these conditions are not met, 
                       write the authors, when the political and economic institutions are "extractive," failure surely follows. It matters not if the Tsars 
                       or the Bolsheviks governed Russia, if the Qing dynasty or Mao ruled China, if Ferdinand and Isabella or General Franco reigned
                        in Spain--all absolutism is the same, erecting historically predictable barriers to prosperity. The critical distinction between, say, 
                       North and South Korea, lies in the vastly different institutional legacies on either side, one open and responsive to the needs and 
                       aspirations of society, the other closed with power narrowly distributed for the benefit of a few. In their wide-ranging discussion, 
                       Acemoglu and Robinson address big-picture concepts like "critical junctures" in history--the Black Death, the discovery of the 
                       Americas, the Glorious Revolution--which disrupt the existing political and economic balance and can abruptly change the 
                       trajectory of nations for better or worse. They also offer a series of small but telling stories in support of their thesis: how the 
                       wealth of Bill Gates differs from the riches of Carlos Slim, why Queen Elizabeth I rejected a patent for a knitting machine, 
                       how the inmates took over the asylum in colonies like Jamestown and New South Wales and why the Ottoman Empire 
                       suppressed the printing press. For economics and political-science students, surely, but also for the general reader who 
                       will appreciate how gracefully the authors wear their erudition.
