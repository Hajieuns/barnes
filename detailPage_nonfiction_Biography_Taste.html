                    Taste is a reflection on the intersection of food and life, filled with anecdotes about 
                    his growing up in Westchester, New York; preparing for and shooting the foodie 
                    films Big Night and Julie & Julia; falling in love over dinner; and teaming up with 
                    his wife to create meals for a multitude of children. Each morsel of this gastronomic 
                    journey through good times and bad, five-star meals and burned dishes, is as 
                    heartfelt and delicious as the last.

                    "Through food and scenes of family life, Stanley Tucci shares both his personal story and his celebration of all-things taste. With tales 
                    from peanut butter sandwiches to lobster in Maine, with recipes from the perfect Negroni to his wife’s roast potatoes, he draws us to his 
                    table. Come hungry for the food, the cocktails, the gossip and the fun. Just never, ever, cut up your spaghetti." –Yotam Ottolenghi

                    "An instant classic, Stanley Tucci's TASTE is as captivating, simple, charming and insanely moreish as the best Italian food. Take it to bed with 
                    you and you will fall asleep dreaming you're in Italy. But take it to the kitchen and you will find yourself using it as often as a pan or a peeler."

                    his food memories. It is as infectious as it is delicious, as funny as it is insightful. The only reason to put this book down,

                    "This superb book...Taste enriches the reader and establishes Tucci as one of the wisest and most generous personalities of our time."

                    "The man, the myth, The Devil Wears Prada legend Stanley Tucci has blessed our hungry souls with a food memoir to feed our 
                    mounting appetite for the actor and cook’s wit, warmth and, let’s face it: tight polo shirts. He divulges some of his most treasured 
                    memories and stories behind favourite recipes — prepare to feel bereaved when it’s over."—Joanna Taylor, Evening Standard              
                </span>
                <span>
                    "Reading this book will make you more attentive to the glorious — or modest — food on your table, and to the people with 
                    whom you are privileged to share it." —Jennifer Reese, The Washington Post

                <span>
                    "Like the enormous layered pasta pie that starred in the 1996 movie Big Night, Stanley Tucci’s new memoir is a 
                    gastronome’s delight." —Bookpage           
                </span>
                <span>
                    "Tucci is not only a prolific actor and writer, but his zest for food, travel, culture, and life is contagious."

                        Actor Tucci waxes nostalgic in his new entry into the realm of culinary memoirs, following his new CBS show Searching for Italy and 
                        two cookbooks (The Tucci Cookbook; The Tucci Table). Tucci begins with a meandering reminiscence about his early years in Westchester 
                        County, New York, with vivid descriptions of his immigrant family's Italian cooking, conveyed in an irreverent, conversational style. Later 
                        chapters delve into fare that Tucci was served by family, restauranteurs, and friends at home, on vacation, and on set—in Italy and beyond. 
                        Some anecdotes are conveyed in the form of scenes from a screenplay, adding a lively, humorous touch. Sprinkled throughout are a handful 
                        of family recipes for cocktails and memorable dishes (e.g., Spaghetti con Zucchine alla Nerano) of varying complexity and portion size. The 
                        book changes course when its focus shifts away from Tucci's own personal experiences and instead begins discussing Italian culinary history 
                        and well-known chefs and personalities (including Julia Child, who needs no introduction). Overall, an entertaining glimpse into Tucci's 
                        passion for cooking both with and for his friends and extended family. VERDICT A no-brainer for fans of Tucci or those interested in food 
                        memoirs; this heartfelt account will also appeal to anyone interested in Italian home cooking.—Rebecca Brody, Westfield State Univ., MA

                        Stanley Tucci narrates this moving, funny, heartwarming, and gut-wrenching audiobook with vigor and style. Not surprisingly, he reads with 
                        an actor’s attention to language, rhythm, and emotion. An Italophile, he pronounces the many mouthwatering Italian dishes—pastas, sauces, and 
                        signature cocktail recipes—with reverence. His delivery of his unalloyed love for generations of Tuccis is personal, and his account of his horrific 
                        battle with throat cancer is revealing. As he describes his lifelong preoccupation with cooking and cuisine, he sounds like an actor stepping to the 
                        front of the stage and talking directly to his audience. His memoir is to be relished—especially as an audiobook. A.D.M. © AudioFile 2021,
