                        In this deeply intimate second poetry collection, Ocean Vuong 
                        searches for life among the aftershocks of personal and social 
                        loss, embodying the paradox of sitting in grief while being 
                        determined to survive beyond it. Shifting through memory, 
                        and in concert with the themes of his novel On Earth We’re 
                        Briefly Gorgeous, Vuong contends with the meaning of family 
                        and the cost of being the product of an American war in 
                        America...

                <p>
                    If you were as moved by Ocean Vuong’s novel On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous as 
                    we were, then now is the moment to absorb his poetry in Time Is a Mother. And 
                    then we urge you to go back to his debut poetry book, Night Sky with Exit Wounds. 
                    Voung’s lyrical writing runs through all his books — whether poetry or prose. You 
                    will always do right to keep his work at the ready.

                    The author of the critically acclaimed poetry collection Night Sky with Exit 
                    Wounds, winner of the 2016 Whiting Award, the 2017 T. S. Eliot Prize, and a 
                    2019 MacArthur fellowship, Vuong writes directly to our humanity without 
                    losing sight of the current moment. These poems represent a more innovative 
                    and daring experimentation with language and form, illuminating how the themes 
                    we perennially live in and question are truly inexhaustible. Bold and prescient, and 
                    a testament to tenderness in the face of violence, Time Is a Mother is a return and a 
                    forging forth all at once.

                    Vuong’s powerful follow-up to Night Sky with Exit Wounds does more than demonstrate poetic growth: it deepens and extends an overarching 
                    project with 27 new poems that reckon with loss and impermanence. Braiding past and present, Vuong’s speakers contextualize personal traumas 
                    within larger systems of dehumanization. Gold becomes a key visual motif for capitalist tendencies: “There is sunlight here, golden enough to take 
                    to the bank” and “Because everyone knows yellow pain, pressed into American letters, turns to gold.” His skillful technique is evident in elegies 
                    such as “Dear Rose,” which describes a mother’s life punctuated by poignant asides (“are you reading this dear/ reader are you my mom yet/ 
                    I cannot find her without you”). “Dear T” offers a meditation on the artistic process: “look—a bit of ink on the pad/ & we’re running down the 
                    street again/ after the thunderstorm/ platelets still plenty// in veins beneath your cheek.” Yet there’s a new, biting insouciance and self-awareness in 
                    Vuong’s voice, “Oh no. The sadness is intensifying. How rude,” turning his trademark epigrammatic flair to darkly humorous effect: “Because 
                    when a man & a man/ walk hand in hand into a bar/ the joke’s on us.” This fantastic book will reward fans while winning this distinctive poet 
                    new ones. (Apr.)

                        motherly, something that can nurture and hold. Written in the aftermath of his mother’s death, Vuong’s poems are raw with grief and darkness, 
                        but there are radical moments of joy and resilience even through that. Through these poems, Vuong sings loud and clear of everything worth 
                        living for and discovering—just as vividly as he did in his critically acclaimed titles On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous and Night Sky With Exit 
                        Wounds.” —NPR, “Books We Love”

                        “Piercing . . . The poems in Time Is a Mother give us a path to examine the complexities of what it means to lose a mother, and what it means 
                        to embrace family and the self even when we want to look away. In Vuong’s tender yet unflinching words, we are reminded that only a mother 
                        can carry a beating heart within her body.” —Los Angeles Review of Books              
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        “Like Orpheus descending into the underworld, Vuong takes us to the white-hot limits of his grief, writing with visionary fervor about love, 
                        agony, and time . . . Aesthetically ambitious and ferociously original . . . Here, he breaks open and rebuilds.”

                    <span>
                        “That’s the essence of Vuong’s talent: he alchemizes deeply individual experiences with universal emotions into what is both familiar and new. . . . 
                        We need no more proof of Vuong’s importance in the poetic canon.” —Chicago Review of Books

                    <span>
                        “An ode to his mother’s passing, Vuong orbits the contours of grief. . . . the poet’s linguistic ferocity illuminates his mother’s spirit from the 
                        rays of memory.” —Associated Press

                    <span>
                        “Aesthetically complex yet emotionally accessible, Time is a Mother at once innovates and affirms the existing poetic tradition. . . . Vuong's 
                        portrait of Hồng is both intimate and iconic.” —NPR.org         
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        “Time Is a Mother builds on the themes of [Vuong’s] previous books, displaying a new degree of precision and elegant power. . . . Time Is a 
                        Mother offers a reckoning with the many versions of ourselves, some altered by time and loss but still true, still open to more life
                        —as a long as we’re willing to risk the depths.” —Nashville Scene            
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        “Vuong’s powerful follow-up to Night Sky with Exit Wounds does more than demonstrate poetic growth: it deepens and extends an overarching 
                        project with 27 new poems that reckon with loss and impermanence . . . This fantastic book will reward fans while winning this distinctive 
                        poet new ones.” —Publishers Weekly (starred review)

                        “[Vuong] focuses on the complicated relationship with his mother in quiet, astonishing lyrics . . . Even the most ostensibly simple moments 
                        prove mesmerizing in Vuong's treatment.” —Booklist (starred review)

                        “Stories of personal loss are woven into vignettes and memories that explore the most sweeping of subjects—addiction, racism, war, death, 
                        family—with a gentle, modest touch and the occasional dose of humor. So, too, does Vuong once again prove himself the rare writer in whose
                         hands experiments with form can become a thing of beauty in and of themselves. . . . Indeed, for all his technical prowess, the most striking 
                        thing about Vuong’s writing will always be its warm, beating heart even in the face of life’s cruelties. . . . It’s a body of work as hauntingly 
                        beautiful as it is ultimately hopeful, and very possibly Vuong’s best yet.” —Vogue.com, “The Best Books of 2022: A Preview”

                        "I was made to die but I'm here to stay," writes Vuong in his second collection. It's perhaps as fitting a theme as there is to be found in the
                        collection, a work that seeks to tease beauty from violence, to find life in pain. Indeed, these intentional contradictions have proved lodestars 
                       in Vuong's work, but here he feels scraped rawer than ever, easily sliding between playfulness and acidity, his language both elliptical and 
                       meticulous. Given its cathartic character—it was written following the death of his eponymous parent in 2019—this collection bears more 
                       thematic resemblance to the author's novel On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous than to his debut work of poetry, the more austere Night Sky 
                       with Exit Wounds. In truth, though, any of the three titles would have proven apt for the author's latest, suffused as they all are with 
                       intimations of mortality. But it's easy to see why this title was picked: Vuong's mother is as present as ever here, woven into poems that 
                       alternately reach back into memory and cast out toward the future, the author's experimentation of form and fluidity of tone adding 
                       further dimension to his articulation of grief's fickle process. VERDICT Enriching Vuong's already sterling early career, this new collection 
                       feels abraded by both the weight of loss and of living, yet is cut with a profusion of affecting beauty and humor.—Luke Gorham

                        Award-winning bestselling author Ocean Vuong narrates a profoundly visceral collection of poetry in which he unfurls his life after the death 
                        of his mother. His voice establishes a heartfelt cadence that fills each poem. He evokes a sense of neediness, as well as sad normalcy, through a 
                        heavy tone and moderately slow pace. Then there are poems—like “Dear Peter,’’ for example—that reveal themselves like a headlong story, 
                        with barely any pauses. In those, Vuong’s staccato, breathy narration suggests feelings of desperation. He speaks as if his life depends on every 
                        word. This work offers a story within a story. Vuong is telling listeners about a particular kind of survival—one that requires moving through 
                        and past tragedies. T.E.C. © AudioFile 2022, Portland, Maine
