                <p>
                    A gorgeous gothic ghost story and a Rebecca for a new age. Cañas delivers an 
                    atmospheric love story set against the backdrop of the Mexican War of

                    Mexican Gothic meets Rebecca in this debut supernatural suspense novel, set in the 
                    aftermath of the Mexican War of Independence, about a remote house, a sinister 
                    haunting, and the woman pulled into their clutches...        
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the overthrow of the Mexican government, Beatriz’s father was executed 
                    and her home destroyed. When handsome Don Rodolfo Solórzano proposes, 
                    Beatriz ignores the rumors surrounding his first wife’s sudden demise, choosing 
                    instead to seize the security that his estate in the countryside provides. She will have 
                    her own home again, no matter the cost.      
                </p>
                <p>
                    But Hacienda San Isidro is not the sanctuary she imagined.        
                </p>
                <p>
                    When Rodolfo returns to work in the capital, visions and voices invade Beatriz’s 
                    sleep. The weight of invisible eyes follows her every move. Rodolfo’s sister, Juana, 
                    scoffs at Beatriz’s fears—but why does she refuse to enter the house at night? Why 
                    does the cook burn copal incense at the edge of the kitchen and mark the doorway 
                    with strange symbols? What really happened to the first Doña Solórzano?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beatriz only knows two things for certain: Something is wrong with the hacienda. 
                    And no one there will save her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Desperate for help, she clings to the young priest, Padre Andrés, as an ally. No 
                    ordinary priest, Andrés will have to rely on his skills as a witch to fight off the 
                    malevolent presence haunting the hacienda and protect the woman for whom he 
                    feels a powerful, forbidden attraction. But even he might not be enough to battle the 
                    darkness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Far from a refuge, San Isidro may be Beatriz’s doom.

                        Mexican Gothic meets Rebecca in Cañas's stunning debut. After Beatriz's mestizo father, General Hernandez, is betrayed
                        seems the perfect escape for Beatriz and her mother. Beatriz’s first sign that something’s off is the housekeeper, who refuses to work without 
                        burning copal incense and chalking glyphs on the kitchen door. Then Beatriz is plagued by bad dreams and mysterious, bloody visions. Her 
                        sister-in-law, Juana, who shares the estate, insists these are signs that Beatriz is going mad. Beatriz, however, comes to believe that her 
                        husband's first wife was murdered and is haunting the house, and she finds an ally in Mestizo priest Padre Andrés, who’s torn between 
                        the folk beliefs of his childhood and his Catholic teachings. To exorcise the house, the pair digs into a past deliberately obscured by those 
                        who would kill them if the truth comes out. Cañas clearly knows the genre, alternately deploying and subverting haunted house tropes. The 
                        result is a brilliant contribution to the new wave of postcolonial Gothics. Readers won’t want to miss this. Agent: Kari Sutherland, Bradford

                        DEBUT Set in the 1820s, in the tumultuous years surrounding the Mexican War of Independence, Cañas's debut introduces readers to recently 
                        disgraced Beatriz, who jumps at the chance for a new start when rich, handsome, and widowed Don Solórzano proposes marriage and moves her 
                        to Hacienda San Isidro. But this beautiful home is anything but a safe haven. The servants won't enter the house at night, there are secrets about 
                        the first Doña Solórzano, and Beatriz spends sleepless nights under attack. Desperate, she seeks out help from Andres, a local priest with ties to 
                        San Isidro. Together they fight to save the house and those who call it home, while finding their true selves along the way. With strong dual 
                        narration by Beatriz and Andres, great pacing, well-placed flashbacks that effortlessly offer up the necessary details, and a strong, foreboding 
                        sense of place, this is a thought-provoking ghost story with monsters that are at once human, systemic, and supernatural. While the plot may 
                        seem to mirror Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca, don't be mistaken—the ghost here is real, and the havoc it causes is nightmare-inducing. 
                        VERDICT For fans of Silvia Moreno-Garcia's Mexican Gothic; but also V. Castro's focus on colonialism, menacing old-world forces, sexism, 
                        class struggle, and vengeance; and Alma Katsu's mastery of historical horror.—Becky Spratford

                        Narrators Victoria Villarreal and Lee Osorio narrate this horror story set in Mexico in 1823. Beatriz marries Rodolfo to have a home after her 
                        father's execution during the revolution. As soon as Beatriz arrives at her new house, she realizes it’s cursed and haunted. She comes to rely on 
                        a local priest named Andres to help her. Andres, practicing indigenous witchcraft that he learned from his grandmother, tries to exorcise the 
                        house. Listeners may find some plot holes puzzling, but the audiobook does give a good fright. Villarreal does a wonderful job portraying 
                        Beatriz; she deftly switches from English to Spanish. Osorio adds depth to the character of Andres, who suffers due to his station in life and 
                        because of his feelings for Beatriz. A.M. © AudioFile 2022, Portland, Maine
