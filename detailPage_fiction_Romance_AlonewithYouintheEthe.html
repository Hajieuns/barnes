                <p>
                    We are convinced Olivie Blake was destined to write in ANY genre. Take your 
                    hand, put it in her hand (that's also holding a pen) and trip into this wonder of a 
                    novel.

                    From the New York Times bestselling author of The Atlas Six comes an intimate 
                    and contemporary study of time, space, and the nature of love. Alone With You In 
                    The Ether explores what it means to be unwell, and how to face the fractures of 
                    yourself and still love as if you're not broken.

                    For Regan, life is a finish line of mutually assured disappointment. Her method of 
                    coping with the dreariness of existence is to project herself into imagined 
                    multipotency, spinning new threads of destiny with every impulsive decision she 
                    makes. For Aldo, life is a plague of constancy—a structure of rules and formulas 
                    that keep him going, without which the entire frame of his existence would collapse.       
                </p>
                <p>
                    For both of them, life is a matter of resigning themselves to the blueprints of 
                    inevitability, until six conversations with a stranger form the variable that glitches 
                    the entire simulation.

                    An artist with bipolar disorder and an obsessive mathematician embark on an unconventional romance in this cerebral love story from Blake 
                    (The Atlas Six). When Art Institute of Chicago docent Charlotte Regan, who’s in court-ordered psychotherapy following a scheme to counterfeit 
                    foreign currency, meets Aldo Damiani, a prickly University of Chicago grad student, their connection is immediate. Aldo urges Regan to agree to 
                    six conversations, over the course of which he intends to understand her. With the bemused tolerance of Regan’s boyfriend, the pair grow closer—
                    so close that Regan offers Aldo “one part of me for your consumption.” She expects him to go for sex, but instead he asks for her art, which she 
                    hasn’t worked on in years. Spurred on, Regan takes up painting, dumps her boyfriend, quits her medication, and launches a volatile, passionate 
                    relationship with Aldo. Blake’s prose is silky and as eccentric as her characters, with an assortment of third-party narrators interrupting the action 
                    in “voice-over.” (“THE NARRATOR, A STUDENT WHO HAS JUST ARRIVED: You can never prepare for weathering anything in Chicago.”) 
                    The message of finding a richer life off mood stabilizers won’t sit well with all readers, but there’s no denying the characters make for fascinating 
                    and complicated studies. This is a book to savor. (Nov.)

                        characters. I utterly devoured this book." — Amanda Foody, New York Times bestselling author of All of Us Villains

                        Regan is a charismatic aspiring artist and failed counterfeiter who struggles to feel or find purpose in anything, a condition she attributes to the pills 
                        she takes to moderate her bipolar disorder. Aldo is a doctoral student in theoretical mathematics whose thought processes are so abstruse and 
                        relentlessly active that he is a terrible lecturer, lacks any close relationships other than with his father, and requires drugs to quiet his brain. One day, 
                        Regan is volunteering as a docent at the Art Institute of Chicago when she encounters Aldo sitting on the floor of a gallery trying to puzzle out the secrets 
                        of time travel. Thus begins a peculiar acquaintanceship built on six important conversations that eventually spark an all-encompassing, dangerously 
                        obsessive love. Is this relationship something that will bring out the potential best from these two, or their worst? The story is somewhat burdened by the 
                        reader's expectations of where it might be going. If an author is currently writing a series of contemporary fantasy novels that incorporate time travel, then 
                        breaks off midsequence to publish a new work with a science fictional–sounding title and a main character obsessed with theoretical time travel, then it’s 
                        natural to assume that, eventually, actual time travel will feature in the plot. These two people are so far outside the ordinary that it’s difficult to conceive 
                        of them existing in this mundane world. The omniscient narrator suggests that the couple’s meeting is an epic moment. All of this is to say that fans of The 
                        Atlas Six (2022) and The Atlas Paradox (2022) expecting magic, time travel, or any other speculative elements may be disappointed when these expectations 
                        are built up to a certain extent but never fulfilled. If this work and Blake’s other books share something, it’s that characters who are not easy to like are still 
                        interesting to read about.

                        Robb Moreira and Sura Siu portray protagonists Aldo and Regan in this contemporary love story. Regan, a bipolar counterfeit artist, and Aldo, a depressed 
                        math professor, meet at the Art Institute and strike up an unusual conversation. They continue to meet, discussing their interests and drawing closer. Siu 
                        illuminates Regan's bipolar states by mixing tempos and changing pitch. Moreira brings Aldo's matter-of-factness and attention to detail to light through 
                        even tones and articulation. The cameos at the beginning of the story are a bit distracting as the audiobook takes on a play format. However, the later 
                        cameos work more naturally within the dialogue. Do not miss author Olivie Blake's note at the end of the book. S.K.G. © AudioFile 2023, Portland, Maine
