                <p class="bold nonunder">
                    The actress, activist, and once infamous Playboy Playmate reclaims the narrative of 
                    her life in a memoir that defies expectation in both content and approach, blending 
                    searing prose with snippets of original poetry.

                    In this honest, layered and unforgettable book that alternates between storytelling 
                    and her own poetry, Pamela Anderson breaks the mold of the celebrity memoir 
                    while taking back the tale that has been crafted about her.

                    Her blond bombshell image was ubiquitous in the 1990s. Discovered in the stands 
                    of a football game, she was immediately rocket launched into fame, becoming 
                    Playboy’s favorite cover girl and an emblem of Hollywood glamour and sexuality. 
                    But what happens when you lose grip on your own life—and the image the notoriety 
                    machine creates for you is not who you really are?              
                </p>
                <p>
                    Growing up on Vancouver Island, the daughter of young, wild, and unprepared 
                    parents, Pamela Anderson’s childhood was not easy, but it allowed her to create her 
                    own world—surrounded by nature and imaginary friends. When she overcame her 
                    deep shyness and grew into herself, she fell into a life on the cover of magazines, the 
                    beaches of Malibu, the sets of movies and talk shows, the arms of rockstars, the 
                    coveted scene at the Playboy Mansion. And as her star rose, she found herself 
                    tabloid fodder, at the height of an era when paparazzi tactics were bent on capturing 
                    a celebrity’s most intimate, and sometimes weakest moments. This is when Pamela 
                    Anderson lost control of her own narrative, hurt by the media and fearful of the 
                    public’s perception of who she was…and who she wasn’t.            
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fighting back with a sense of grace, fueled by a love of art and literature, and driven 
                    by a devotion to her children and the causes she cares about most, Pamela Anderson 
                    has now gone back to the island where she grew up, after a memorable run starring 
                    as Roxie in Chicago on Broadway, reclaiming her free spirit but also standing firm 
                    as a strong, creative, confident woman.

                    Model and actor Anderson chronicles her rise to fame in this pensive memoir. Growing up on Vancouver Island, Anderson loved 
                    spending time on the beach, though her childhood was also marked by abuse and a rape when she was an early teen. Even so, she 
                    writes, her upbringing was “the ultimate gift... I was raised in a way where nobody was telling me what to do or how to be, or how 
                    to think, or what to believe, and I’m eternally grateful for that.” Her life changed dramatically after she appeared on a Jumbotron at 
                    a football game, and before long she was on the cover of Playboy in 1989. Anderson speaks of her career with nostalgia: acting on TV 
                    series Baywatch opened the door to films, while Playboy continued to offer new opportunities, though, she writes, “My life took off 
                    without me.” Now, as a mother of two, Anderson considers being a mother her “priority and greatest source of pride.” Though she 
                    can contradict herself (modeling is “empty, shallow, and weird,” but posing for Playboy was “empowering”), she is frank about her 
                    inner turmoil, notably about longing for others to see through her carefully curated persona: “How could I expect anyone to love me 
                    enough to see through it all?” This poetic and free-spirited narrative reflects both Anderson’s naivete and her wild spirit. Agent:

                        While best known as a Playboy cover model and star of Baywatch and Barb Wire, Anderson reveals the woman behind the iconic image in this 
                        intimate and well-written journey of self-discovery, uncovering the layers that make up her complicated past and sharing her lifelong thirst for 
                        knowledge. As a child, Anderson learned Finnish to converse with her beloved grandfather, begged her father to stop hunting as she became a 
                        staunch animal-rights activist, and overcame her chaotic home life, abusive babysitter, and cruel boyfriends by moving out at 17. Discovered at a 
                        football game, Anderson fell into a career of modeling and acting, stating "fame just happens." Claiming men are her downfall, Anderson recounts 
                        her passionate and turbulent relationship with Tommy Lee, her friendship with Julian Assange, and brief engagement to Kid Rock, while revealing 
                        the major influences in her life—the poets, artists, and writers who inspired her own artistic endeavors. Anderson shares her poetry throughout, 
                        providing insight into a woman hounded for years by the paparazzi, yet who managed to remain an enigma. VERDICT Anderson fully takes control 
                        of her own story, addressing the salacious aspects but also sharing inspiring tales of survival, motherhood, and activism.—Lisa Henry

                        According to the acknowledgments, this memoir started as "a fifty-page poem and then grew into hundreds of pages of…more poetry." Readers will 
                        be glad that Anderson eventually turned to writing prose, since the well-told anecdotes and memorable character sketches are what make it a page-turner. 
                        The poetry (more accurately described as italicized notes-to-self with line breaks) remains strewn liberally through the pages, often summarizing the 
                        takeaway or the emotional impact of the events described: "I was / and still am / an exceptionally / easy target. / And, / I'm proud of that." This way 
                        of expressing herself is part of who she is, formed partly by her passion for Anaïs Nin and other writers; she is a serious maven of literature and the 
                        arts. The narrative gets off to a good start with Anderson’s nostalgic memories of her childhood in coastal Vancouver, raised by very young, very 
                        wild, and not very competent parents. Here and throughout the book, the author displays a remarkable lack of anger. She has faced abuse and 
                        mistreatment of many kinds over the decades, but she touches on the most appalling passages lightly—though not so lightly you don't feel the torment 
                        of the media attention on the events leading up to her divorce from Tommy Lee. Her trip to the pages of Playboy, which involved an escape from a 
                        violent fiance and sneaking across the border, is one of many jaw-dropping stories. In one interesting passage, Julian Assange's mother counsels 
                        Anderson to desexualize her image in order to be taken more seriously as an activist. She decided that “it was too late to turn back now”—that sexy 
                        is an inalienable part of who she is. Throughout her account of this kooky, messed-up, enviable, and often thrilling life, her humility (her sons "are 
                        true miracles, considering the gene pool") never fails her.
