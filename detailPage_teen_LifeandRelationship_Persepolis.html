                    Persepolis paints an unforgettable portrait of daily life in Iran and of the bewildering 
                    contradictions between home life and public life. Marjane’s child’s-eye view of 
                    dethroned emperors, state-sanctioned whippings, and heroes of the revolution 
                    allows us to learn as she does the history of this fascinating country and of her own 
                    extraordinary family. Intensely personal, profoundly political, and wholly original, 
                    Persepolis is at once a story of growing up and a reminder of the human cost of war 
                    and political repression. It shows how we carry on, with laughter and tears, in the 
                    face of absurdity. And, finally, it introduces us to an irresistible little girl with whom 
                    we cannot help but fall in love.

                    in the west, and feared and suspected in proportion to being unknown.... Satrap has found a way of depicting human beings that is both simple and 
                    immediately comprehensible, AND is almost infinitely flexible. Anyone who's tried to draw a simplified version of a human face knows how immensely 
                    difficult it is not only to give the faces a range of expression, but also to maintain identities from one frame to the next. It's an enormous technical

                     tossed from one political hypocrisy to another. Aside from the humanistic dimension, the beautifully minimalist Persepolis gives further evidence of Marjane

                        Satrapi's drawing style is bold and vivid. She paints a thick inky black-on-white, in a faux-naif pastiche of East and West. Persepolis deploys all the 
                        paranoid Expressionism latent in the comic strip's juxtapositions of scale -- the child dwarfed by looming parents, would-be rescuers dwarfed by giant 
                        policemen guarding the locked doors to a movie theater that's been set on fire -- 
                        but when Satrapi depicts a schoolyard brawl, it's straight from Persian miniature.

                         of the East,' by which he meant the scientific backwardness he believed Islam had 'brought upon' us."

                        Amid the jarring disruptions of life in Tehran during the nineteen-eighties, Marjane Satrapi could at least confide in her parents. Her comic-book memoir, 
                        Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood, describes her pain at seeing her country descend into fundamentalism and violence. Satrapi was patriotic; she was 
                        relieved to see her father cheer when the BBC confirmed that Iranian bombers had hit Baghdad. Later, though, the slogans scrawled on city walls "To die 
                        a martyr is to inject blood into the veins of society") made her fearful that the country's turn toward bellicosity was too extreme.

                        Satrapi's autobiography is a timely and timeless story of a young girl's life under the Islamic Revolution. Descended from the last Emperor of Iran, Satrapi
                        is nine when fundamentalist rebels overthrow the Shah. While Satrapi's radical parents and their community initially welcome the ouster, they soon learn 
                       a new brand of totalitarianism is taking over. Satrapi's art is minimal and stark yet often charming and humorous as it depicts the madness around her. 
                       She idolizes those who were imprisoned by the Shah, fascinated by their tales of torture, and bonds with her Uncle Anoosh, only to see the new regime 
                       imprison and eventually kill him. Thanks to the Iran-Iraq war, neighbors' homes are bombed, playmates are killed and parties are forbidden. Satrapi's
                        parents, who once lived in luxury despite their politics, struggle to educate their daughter. Her father briefly considers fleeing to America, only to realize
                        the price would be too great. "I can become a taxi driver and you a cleaning lady?" he asks his wife. Iron Maiden, Nikes and Michael Jackson become 
                       precious symbols of freedom, and eventually Satrapi's rebellious streak puts her in danger, as even educated women are threatened with beatings for 
                       improper attire. Despite the grimness, Satrapi never lapses into sensationalism or sentimentality. Skillfully presenting a child's view of war and her own
                        shifting ideals, she also shows quotidian life in Tehran and her family's pride and love for their country despite the tumultuous times. Powerfully
                        understated, this work joins other memoirs-Spiegelman's Maus and Sacco's Safe Area Goradze-that use comics to make the unthinkable familiar.

                        This extraordinary autobiography tells the story of Satrapi's early life as a girl in late 1970s and early 1980s Iran. Through her young eyes, the reader sees the
                        overthrow of the Shah, the Islamic fundamentalist rise to power, and the war with Iraq. Satrapi was a religious girl who grew up in a progressive family and
                        went to a French school; but after the Islamic revolution, she was forced to wear the veil and ended up rejecting God. Under increasing threat from Iraqi 
                       bombings and an oppressive government, Satrapi and her family still managed to enjoy forbidden parties, games, and music (such as Iron Maiden). This 
                       fueled Satrapi's own adolescent rebellion, which eventually got her into trouble. Satrapi's simple, cartoony, even cute black-and-white art allows for easy 
                       identification with the characters and expertly reflects their varying emotions. When first published in France, where Satrapi now lives, this book won 
                       several European comics awards-and it's a prime candidate for American award nominations as well. A remarkable, revealing, and sometimes startling 
                       account, this is sure to be one of the most important graphic novels of the year. Highly recommended for older teens and adults. [Previewed in Prepub

                        Adult/High School-Marji tells of her life in Iran from the age of 10, when the Islamic revolution of 1979 reintroduced a religious state, through the age of 
                        14 when the Iran-Iraq war forced her parents to send her to Europe for safety. This story, told in graphic format with simple, but expressive, black-and-white
                         illustrations, combines the normal rebelliousness of an intelligent adolescent with the horrors of war and totalitarianism. Marji's parents, especially her 
                        freethinking mother, modeled a strong belief in freedom and equality, while her French education gave her a strong faith in God. Her Marxist-inclined 
                        family initially favored the overthrow of the Shah, but soon realized that the new regime was more restrictive and unfair than the last. The girl's 
                        independence, which made her parents both proud and fearful, caused them to send her to Austria. With bold lines and deceptively uncomplicated scenes,
                         Satrapi conveys her story. From it, teens will learn much of the history of this important area and will identify with young Marji and her friends. This is a
                         graphic novel of immense power and importance for Westerners of all ages. It will speak to the same audience as Art Spiegelman's Maus (Pantheon, 1993).
