                <p class="bold nonunder">
                    "A fairy tale in the oldest and truest sense: a haunting dream full of blood and love, vicious truths and beautiful lies. It swallowed me whole, and I went willingly." — Alix E. Harrow, New York Times bestselling author of Starling House
                </p>
                <p class="bold">
                    “Decadence laced with horror . . . A delightfully meta fairy tale . . . Magic emanates from every exquisitely crafted sentence.” — Charlie Jane Anders, Washington Post   
                </p>
                <p class="bold">
                    In the tradition of sumptuous gothic novels like Starling House and The Bloody Chamber comes a dark fairy tale-infused story about a cursed friendship and a marriage steeped in secrets—the breathtaking adult debut from New York Times bestselling author Roshani Chokshi. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once upon a time, a man who believed in fairy tales married a beautiful, mysterious woman named Indigo Maxwell-Casteñada. He was a scholar of myths. She was an heiress. In exchange for her love, Indigo extracted a promise: that her bridegroom would never pry into her past. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    But when the couple returns to Indigo’s childhood home, the House of Dreams, the bridegroom will soon find himself unable to resist. For within the crumbling manor’s extravagant rooms lurks the shadow of another girl: Azure, Indigo’s dearest childhood friend, who suddenly disappeared. As the house slowly reveals his wife’s secrets, the bridegroom will be forced to choose between reality and fantasy, even if doing so threatens to destroy their marriage . . . or their lives. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through a tapestry of secrets woven around dangerous shards of truth, Chokshi crafts an atmospheric fever dream of a novel about love and lies, secrets and betrayal, and the stories we tell ourselves to survive.

                    Bestseller Chokshi (best known for the YA novel The Gilded Wolves) makes her adult debut with a lush and haunting modern fairy tale about the nature of friendship and love. Indigo Maxwell-Casteñada, the heiress to a fortune, wants for nothing but love. She finds it in the unnamed narrator, a man who embraces all things mysterious and unexplained. Their marriage is built on sharing fairy stories, playing fantastical games, and maintaining a no questions asked policy about Indigo’s past. But when Indigo’s dying aunt and onetime guardian forces them to return to the House of Dreams, Indigo’s childhood home, secrets bubble to the surface. The ghost of Indigo’s childhood best friend clings to the House of Dreams and begs to be acknowledged. Soon fantasy and reality blur, testing the strength of the couple’s love, and even threatening their lives. Chokshi’s prose overflows with metaphor and lavish imagery, adding to the decadent, gothic feel as the mystery of Indigo’s past intensifies. The result is equal parts dizzying, dazzling, and foreboding. Agent: Thao Le, Sandra Dijkstra Literary. (Feb.)

                    <span>How well do you really know the person you married? That’s the question at the heart of Roshani Chokshi’s unsettlingly gorgeous adult fantasy. In the book, a man is forced to face uncomfortable truths about his mysterious wife, Indigo, on a trip to her childhood home. . . . This book is for anyone who loves dark fairy tales and is obsessed with the monstrous nature of teenage girlhood.” — Kalyani Saxena, NPR, “Best Books of the Year”</span>
                    <span>"A delightfully meta fairy tale . . . The Last Tale of the Flower Bride is a fine addition to the shelf of novels about ordinary people being seduced by wealth and glamour — but its real strength is the way magic emanates from every exquisitely crafted sentence. . . . It feels like the best conjuring trick ever." — Charlie Jane Anders, Washington Post</span>
                    <span>"Chokshi's tale is as sweet as a piece of fairy fruit, and just as wicked. Every bite is velvet, every swallow is gold, and the taste lingers like a fever dream." — V. E. Schwab, #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue</span>
                    <span>"A dazzling fairy tale for adults. . . . Take a fairy tale, infuse it with a gothic flair, drizzle in some dark romance, and you get The Last Tale of the Flower Bride." — Time, Best Books of February 2023</span>
                    <span>"Chokshi’s writing is vivid and lovely." — Entertainment Weekly</span>
                    <span>“Darkly gorgeous and utterly entrancing, Chokshi's adult fairy tale is as deadly as any fable of old; the lush, glittering prose and haunting mystery gilding a story sharper than a huntsman's blade.” — Shannon Chakraborty, bestselling author of The City of Brass</span>
                    <span>"Gorgeous and ornate, this sensual fairy tale illuminates the corrosive and redemptive power of both love and lies." — Holly Black, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Book of Night</span>
                    <span> "Like the best Gothic novels, The Last Tale of the Flower Bride lures you in, cups you in a dreamlike trance, and—most impressively—makes the whole trick look effortless. A story of obsessive bonds and the lies we eagerly devour to be loved, it is at once exquisitely intense and profoundly sad. Reader, I was at its mercy. " — Isabel Cañas, bestselling author of The Hacienda</span>
                    <span>"Roshani Chokshi's transfixing first novel for adults is a fairytale-infused story about marriage and the secrets couples keep from each other. That, and an enchanted house off the coast of Washington and hotel fortune." — Today.com</span>

                    <span>DEBUT Once upon a time, a man who studied fairy tales fell in love with a woman who believed she lived in one. The story centers on an unnamed groom who has promised not to question his beautiful, mysterious wife about her shrouded past. They enjoy a lush, sensual romance of delights, games, and illusions, cocooned from the real world by her wealth and his ability to tell stories. At least until circumstances carry them back to her childhood home, where an entirely different fairy tale played itself out over the days of her youth. When he breaks his promise and delves into his wife's true heart, he expects that truth to be deadly. And so it is—but it still manages to set them both free. The gothic atmosphere of this fairy-tale romance, mixed with heartbreaking tragedy, creates a story that hovers between fantasy and illusion. It begins with an enchantment and ends with its breaking. In between, a dream becomes a nightmare—until they both wake up. VERDICT Chokshi's (Aru Shah and the Nectar of Immortality) adult debut is recommended for lovers of gothic romance, magical realism, and stories where fairy tales come true, especially when they shouldn't.—Marlene Harris</span>

                    <span>This novel begins with the wealthy and famous recluse Indigo Maxwell-Casteñada's husband narrating as he meets and falls in love with her. It is almost a fairy tale of love at first sight, but from the beginning they keep secrets from each other. Over time he learns about Indigo and her childhood, while their own tangled web of secrets grows. Then Indigo's best friend, Azure, tells of their wonderful yet obsessive friendship, and the magical world Indigo created for them. Fairy tales are infused into every aspect of the story, but slowly shift from Disney fantasy to Brothers Grimm mash-ups. Elements of "Snow White" dominate at first, like the girls' pale skin and long silky black hair, so alike they are often mistaken for each other. But then notes of "Bluebeard" rise and forbidden rooms, forbidden memories, and forbidden futures seep in to build the tension to a breaking point. This twist on a contemporary fairy tale is a page-turner and culminates in a surprise ending. VERDICT A gripping addition to the reimagined fairy-tale genre; give this to fans of Melissa Bashardoust's Girls Made of Snow and Glass, Sarah J. Maas's "A Court of Thorn and Roses" series, and Margaret Owen's Little Thieves.—Gretchen Crowley</span>

                    <span>Narrators Steve West and Sura Siu capture the atmospheric tone of this haunting gothic romance. An unnamed bridegroom weds mysterious Indigo Maxwell-Casteñada. When her aunt becomes ill, they travel to Indigo’s childhood home, the House of Dreams. There, the bridegroom learns about Indigo’s childhood best friend, Azure. Chapters alternate between the bridegroom in the present, voiced by West, and Azure in the past, voiced by Siu. As secrets about Azure and Indigo’s relationship and Azure’s disappearance slowly unravel, reality and fantasy become blurred. West shines in his performance, commanding scenes with his deep, smooth British-accented delivery. This creates an interesting contrast with Siu’s higher pitch and sharp tone. The performances and lush writing create an enchanting listening experience. V.T.M. © AudioFile 2023, Portland, Maine</span>

                    <span>In Chokshi's gothic fairy tale, a poor academic marries a glamorous heiress who makes him vow not to search for her secrets.</span>
                    <span>A fairy-tale scholar known only as “the bridegroom” meets the mysterious, fabulously wealthy Indigo Maxwell-Casteñada when he asks to see a rare book from her family’s private collection. Almost immediately, he and Indigo embark on a whirlwind romance fueled by their mutual love of stories. But despite her passion for him, Indigo keeps the bridegroom at a distance, making him promise never to dig into her past. Then, when Indigo gets word that the aunt who raised her is dying, she and the bridegroom return to her childhood home, the House of Dreams. The mysterious mansion is bursting with Indigo’s secrets, making it harder and harder for the bridegroom to keep his promise, especially when it comes to the question of Indigo’s childhood friend Azure. Azure, a working-class girl from the neighborhood, was like a sister to Indigo until they had a fight and she completely disappeared. As the bridegroom dives further into Indigo’s past, he realizes he may be at risk of disappearing, too. Chokshi’s novel is a true fairy tale, both in its poetic, fantastical imagery and its thematic interest in the price people pay for freedom and love. The parallels between the bridegroom and Azure as mere mortals faced with Indigo’s impossible privilege, and the connection between Indigo and Azure as young girls enamored with creating their own magic, make the tension bubble higher and higher until it boils over. And as in the best folktales, the issues at the crux of the otherworldly struggles here are simply, and painfully, human.</span>
                    <span>A singular, unforgettable tale of love and magic.</span>
