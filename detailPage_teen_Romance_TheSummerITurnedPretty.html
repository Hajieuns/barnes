                    series is perfect for those who love a good slow-burn romance. Is this the summer
                     that Belly finally gets with Conrad? Or will she end up with Jeremiah?      
                </p>
                <p class="bold">
                    Belly has an unforgettable summer in this stunning start to the Summer I Turned 
                    Pretty series from the New York Times bestselling author of To All the Boys I’ve

                    Belly measures her life in summers. Everything good, everything magical happens 
                    between the months of June and August. Winters are simply a time to count the 
                    weeks until the next summer, a place away from the beach house, away from 
                    Susannah, and most importantly, away from Jeremiah and Conrad. They are the 
                    boys that Belly has known since her very first summer—they have been her brother 
                    figures, her crushes, and everything in between. But one summer, one wonderful and 
                    terrible summer, the more everything changes, the more it all ends up just the way it 
                    should have been all along.

                    "This book has what every girl wants in a summer." — Sarah Dessen, author of Just Listen and Lock and Key
                </span>
                <span>
                    "The Summer I Turned Pretty offers a hard-to-resist combination — a beach house, summer love, enduring friendship. A deliciously sweet read." 
                    — Deb Caletti, author of Honey, Baby, Sweetheart and Wild Roses      
                </span>
                <span>
                    "If I could live inside this amazing book, I would. I would inhale the ocean air and soak up the sun, and I would hang out all day with kind-wonderful
                    -funny-awkward Belly and her two known-'em-forever buds, Jeremiah and Conrad. I'd watch the three of them stop being kids and start being more...
                    and I'd hope hope hope that when Belly falls in love — 'cause you know she will — she'd give her heart to the exact right boy." 
                    — Lauren Myracle, author of the ttyl series and Bliss        
                </span>
                <span>
                    "This well-written coming-of-age story introduces 15-year-old Isabel, aka Belly, for whom summer has always been the most important time of year. 
                    Han (Shug) realistically balances Belly's naïveté with her awareness of the changes the years have brought. Han's novel offers plenty of summertime 
                    drama." — Starred review from Publishers Weekly        
                </span>
                <span>
                    "Belly's dawning awareness of her sexuality and that of the boys is a strong theme, as is the sense of summer as a separate and reflective time and place. 
                    Readers get glimpses of kisses on the beach, her best friend's flirtations during one summer's visit, a first date." — Kirkus Reviews

                        This well-written coming-of-age story introduces 15-year-old Isabel, aka Belly, for whom summer has always been the most important 
                        time of year: it's when her family shares a beach house with her mother's best friend, Susannah, and her two sons. Like Belly's older 
                        brother, Steven, Susannah's boys have always thought of Belly as their younger sister. But this summer-"It was the summer everything 
                        began"-is different. One brother, Jeremiah, is suddenly interested in Belly, but she has always had a crush on dark and unattainable 
                        Conrad. And then there is Cam, also spending the summer at the beach, who becomes Belly's first boyfriend. Han (Shug) realistically 
                        balances Belly's naïveté with her awareness of the changes the years have brought ("In some ways it was even harder being the only girl
                         back then. In some ways not"). Anecdotal chapters of past summers are interspersed, rounding out Belly's character, her attachment to
                         Susannah and her desire for the boys to include her. First in a planned trilogy, Han's novel offers plenty of summertime drama to keep 
                        readers looking forward to the next installment. Ages 12-up. (May)

                        Romantic and heartbreakingly real, this novel follows 15-year-old Belly through the most important summer of her life. Every year, her 
                        family shares a beach house with Belly's mother's best friend, Susannah, and her two sons. Belly has always had a crush on Conrad, the 
                        older boy, but he has always treated her like an annoying younger sister. This summer, everything changes. The beautifully written novel
                         captures Belly's realization that she is changing into an attractive young woman with a growing power over the boys in her life. They 
                        include Cam, the "nice" boy she should fall for but doesn't, and Jeremiah, Susannah's younger son. Only Conrad is seemingly immune to
                         Belly's charms. Meanwhile, Susannah and her family are dealing with problems that Belly does not fully comprehend. Flashbacks to 
                        previous summers show her struggles to make Conrad and Jeremiah notice and include her, and how hurt she was when they didn't. 
                        The novel perfectly blends romance, family drama, and a coming-of-age tale, one that is substantially deeper than most, but it will still 
                        satisfy those hoping for a soapy story of summer love. Belly's discovery that you can't always choose who you love will appeal to readers,
                         as will the author's expert evocation of a magical time when absolutely anything could happen.-Miranda Doyle, San Francisco Unified

                        Han's leisurely paced, somewhat somber narrative revisits several beach-house summers in flashback through the eyes of now 15-year-old
                        Isabel, known to all as Belly. Belly measures her growing self by these summers and by her lifelong relationship with the older boys, her 
                       brother and her mother's best friend's two sons. Belly's dawning awareness of her sexuality and that of the boys is a strong theme, as is 
                       the sense of summer as a separate and reflective time and place: Readers get glimpses of kisses on the beach, her best friend's flirtations 
                       during one summer's visit, a first date. In the background the two mothers renew their friendship each year, and Lauren, Belly's mother, 
                       provides support for her friend-if not, unfortunately, for the children-in Susannah's losing battle with breast cancer. Besides the mostly 
                       off-stage issue of a parent's severe illness there's not much here to challenge most readers-driving, beer-drinking, divorce, a moment of 
                       surprise at the mothers smoking medicinal pot together. The wish-fulfilling title and sun-washed, catalog-beautiful teens on the cover will 
                       be enticing for girls looking for a diversion. (Fiction. 12-14)

                        Isabel (Belly) revels in summer. For as long as she can remember, her family has spent the summer at the beach with her mom’s friend, 
                        Susannah, and her two sons, Conrad and Jeremiah. Belly is convinced that this summer, the summer of her sixteenth birthday, will be the 
                        best yet. Jessica Almasy is convincing as the naïve Belly. The angst and insecurity embedded in Belly’s character resonate in Almasy’s voice
                         as she catches us up on summers past through a series of flashbacks. As we learn of past crushes and kisses, Belly stumbles through the
                         complexities of her current feelings for both Conrad and Jeremiah. Then there’s a bigger challenge for the families to face as the summer
                         draws to a close. E.A.B. © AudioFile 2011, Portland, Maine
