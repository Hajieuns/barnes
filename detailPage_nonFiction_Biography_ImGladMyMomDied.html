                    Readers get the chance to learn how "the industry" really works, as Jennette 
                    describes what it's like as a child star, further fueling the narrative, of late, around 
                    how victimizing Hollywood can be. Jennette is direct, honest and hilarious, and 
                    despite it all, delivers an inspiring story of resilience and recovery.

                    A heartbreaking and hilarious memoir by iCarly and Sam & Cat star Jennette 
                    McCurdy about her struggles as a former child actor—including eating disorders, 
                    addiction, and a complicated relationship with her overbearing mother—and how 
                    she retook control of her life.

                    Jennette McCurdy was six years old when she had her first acting audition. Her 
                    mother’s dream was for her only daughter to become a star, and Jennette would do 
                    anything to make her mother happy. So she went along with what Mom called 
                    “calorie restriction,” eating little and weighing herself five times a day. She endured 
                    extensive at-home makeovers while Mom chided, “Your eyelashes are invisible, 
                    okay? You think Dakota Fanning doesn’t tint hers?” She was even showered by 
                    Mom until age sixteen while sharing her diaries, email, and all her income.         
                </p>
                <p>
                    In I’m Glad My Mom Died, Jennette recounts all this in unflinching detail—just as 
                    she chronicles what happens when the dream finally comes true. Cast in a new 
                    Nickelodeon series called iCarly, she is thrust into fame. Though Mom is ecstatic, 
                    emailing fan club moderators and getting on a first-name basis with the paparazzi 
                    (“Hi Gale!”), Jennette is riddled with anxiety, shame, and self-loathing, which 
                    manifest into eating disorders, addiction, and a series of unhealthy relationships. 
                    These issues only get worse when, soon after taking the lead in the iCarly spinoff 
                    Sam & Cat alongside Ariana Grande, her mother dies of cancer. Finally, after 
                    discovering therapy and quitting acting, Jennette embarks on recovery and decides 
                    for the first time in her life what she really wants.              
                </p>
                <p>
                    Told with refreshing candor and dark humor, I’m Glad My Mom Died is an 
                    inspiring story of resilience, independence, and the joy of shampooing your own hair.

                    In this explosive debut, former iCarly star McCurdy recounts a harrowing childhood directed by her emotionally abusive stage mother. 
                    A narcissist and “full-blown hoarder,” McCurdy’s mother, Debra, pushed her daughter into acting at age six in 1999, doling out her 
                    scarce affection in tandem with the jobs McCurdy booked (while weaponizing her breast cancer—which eventually killed her in 2013
                    —for good measure). After McCurdy hit puberty around age 11, her mother steered her to anorexia via “calorie restriction,” and later 
                    began performing invasive breast and genital exams on McCurdy at age 17. As she recounts finding fame on Nickelodeon, beginning in 
                    2007 with her role on iCarly, McCurdy chronicles her efforts to break free from her mother’s machinations, her struggles with bulimia 
                    and alcohol abuse, and a horrific stint dating a schizophrenic, codependent boyfriend. McCurdy’s recovery is hard-won and messy, and 
                    eventually leads her to step back from acting to pursue writing and directing. Despite the provocative title, McCurdy shows remarkable

                        [A] layered account of a woman reckoning with love and violence at once...[Not] a flippant exposé of childhood stardom, nor an angry diatribe 
                        directed at an abuser. This complexity is what makes I’m Glad My Mom Died feel real...Some supposed literary types will think the immense 
                        popularity of I’m Glad My Mom Died—the hardcover initially sold out at many major bookstores—is merely the result of McCurdy’s former 
                        stardom and modern culture’s thirst for a sensational take. With its bold headline and bright cover featuring a smirking McCurdy holding a 
                        pink urn, the book feels deliberately marketed for virality, perfect for sharing on the internet and catching the eye of bookstore browsers. I’ve 
                        mentioned the title of this memoir to some people who have dismissed it out of hand, remarking that being glad one’s parent is dead is crude 
                        and a sentiment that should be kept to oneself. But those people haven’t read the book. McCurdy takes her time to remember difficult and 
                        complex moments of her life, staying true to her younger self while ultimately trying to come to terms with who she is as an independent 
                        adult. It’s a triumph of the confessional genre.”—Nina Li Coomes, The Atlantic

                        poverty and trauma. Taking advantage of the store discount at your dad’s retail job, tuning out screaming matches between parents, avoiding 
                        calls from debt collectors ... this is what childhood is like for millions of Americans. Like many, I recognized myself in her words.”

                        multiple eating disorders and processing decades of trauma. It's finally doing what she wants for the first time: not acting. Writing...Healing 
                        from trauma looks different for everyone: For McCurdy, writing this memoir symbolized empowerment over her narrative. And understanding

                        “Judging simply by the shocking title of Jennette McCurdy’s debut memoir, I’m Glad My Mom Died, you may think the book is a no-holds-
                        barred, scathing takedown of her mother and everyone else who perpetuated the horrifying upbringing that the former iCarly star endured, 
                        but you’d be wrong. McCurdy’s book is certainly revealing, describing the abuse she endured from her mother, who pushed her into acting 
                        at age 6, then guided her directly into an eating disorder and much worse until her death in 2013. But beyond that, it’s a measured, 
                        heartbreakingly poignant, and often laugh-out-loud-funny memoir with McCurdy showing more sympathy for her complicated mother 
                        than most people could even imagine mustering. However, what is perhaps most important about her memoir, which is smart, well-written, 
                        and powerful, is just how much hope and help it will surely provide to those suffering similar abuses right now.”—Scott Neumyer, Shondaland

                        the book, McCurdy, who built her name on Nickelodeon’s iCarly and Sam and Cat, more than makes her case, detailing years of her 
                        mother’s mental and physical abuse. The result is a detailed look at a very specific and individual childhood of horrors, but it also 
                        points to a major systemic problem. I’m Glad My Mom Died doubles as a damning indictment of the child star system...She paints a 
                        vivid picture of child stardom as a system in which children find themselves turned into walking piles of other people’s cash, and 
                        summarily dismantled when they lose their value. It’s damning both for the horrors she experienced as an individual and the systemic

                        Former child actor McCurdy's memoir of growing up in Hollywood is divided into two parts: "Before" her mother's death and 
                        "After." In "Before," McCurdy's overbearing mother works to achieve stardom for her young daughter. Wanting to please her 
                        mother, McCurdy endures endless auditions, eyelash tinting, daily weigh-ins, guilt trips, and personal showers from her mother 
                        well into her teens. Her mother makes Mommy Dearest look like Mother of the Year. Though McCurdy achieved success 
                        (Nickelodeon's TV series iCarly and the spin-off Sam and Cat with Ariana Grande), it was not without a price. In "After," 
                        she recounts coping with bulimia, addiction, and bad relationships. Once she achieved the fame her mother sought for her,
                         she writes, "I realize that she's happy and I'm not. Her happiness came at the cost of mine. I feel robbed and exploited." 
                        But McCurdy eventually sought help and found herself. While this is a grim tale of a lost childhood, not unlike stories of 
                        other child actors, McCurdy is a good writer and her compelling story is not without dark humor. VERDICT For those

                        In her debut memoir, titled after her 2020 one-woman show, singer and actor McCurdy (b. 1992) reveals the raw details of what 
                        she describes as years of emotional abuse at the hands of her demanding, emotionally unstable stage mom, Debra. Born in Los 
                        Angeles, the author, along with three older brothers, grew up in a home controlled by her mother. When McCurdy was 3, her 
                        mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. Though she initially survived, the disease’s recurrence would ultimately take her life
                         when the author was 21. McCurdy candidly reconstructs those in-between years, showing how “my mom emotionally, mentally, 
                        and physically abused me in ways that will forever impact me.” Insistent on molding her only daughter into “Mommy’s little 
                        actress,” Debra shuffled her to auditions beginning at age 6. As she matured and starting booking acting gigs, McCurdy 
                        remained “desperate to impress Mom,” while Debra became increasingly obsessive about her daughter’s physical appearance. 
                        She tinted her daughter’s eyelashes, whitened her teeth, enforced a tightly monitored regimen of “calorie restriction,” and 
                        performed regular genital exams on her as a teenager. Eventually, the author grew understandably resentful and tried to 
                        distance herself from her mother. As a young celebrity, however, McCurdy became vulnerable to eating disorders, alcohol 
                        addiction, self-loathing, and unstable relationships. Throughout the book, she honestly portrays Debra’s cruel perfectionist 
                        personality and abusive behavior patterns, showing a woman who could get enraged by everything from crooked eyeliner 
                        to spilled milk. At the same time, McCurdy exhibits compassion for her deeply flawed mother. Late in the book, she 
                        shares a crushing secret her father revealed to her as an adult. While McCurdy didn’t emerge from her childhood unscathed, 
                        she’s managed to spin her harrowing experience into a sold-out stage act and achieve a form of catharsis that puts her mind, 
                        body, and acting career at peace.

                        As emotionally exhausting as this relentlessly harrowing and downbeat memoir is for listeners, one can only imagine the toll it 
                        must have taken for McCurdy to write and read it aloud. McCurdy does an excellent job reading her brutally honest memoir 
                        about being forced into an acting career she never wanted, to please her obsessive-compulsive mother. "My mom emotionally, 
                        mentally, and physically abused me in ways that will forever impact me," she tells listeners. Her mother was a cancer survivor 
                        who used that diagnosis to leverage jobs for her daughter and to keep her family under her thumb. Her control over McCurdy, 
                        the family's meal ticket, was nearly complete. When McCurdy started developing breasts, her mother immediately put her on a 
                        restrictive diet to keep her small. Her mother's control tightens when McCurdy wins a costarring role on TV's iCarly. When her 
                        mother's cancer returns and she dies, McCurdy begins a downward spiral into anorexia, bulimia, and alcoholism. 
                        VERDICT McCurdy's battle over her demons will leave many listeners exhausted, but her excellent reading makes for a

                        In her memoir, author/narrator Jennette McCurdy uses a dynamic voice for her mother’s lines and a flat tone for much of her 
                        own thoughts and dialogue. The writer, director, podcaster, singer, and former child actor shares details of her dark adolescence. 
                        Years after her mother’s death, she is now coming to terms with the emotional and physical abuse she endured from a mother 
                        who makes other stage moms seem sweet. Her story makes clear that her career and personal habits were formed in direct response 
                        to that abuse. In one scene, she illuminates her volatile home by depicting a shouting match between her parents with moans and
                         sobs. In a lighter moment, she uses a high pitch to showcase a JELL-O commercial she did as a kid. A.L.C. © AudioFile 2022, Portland, Maine
