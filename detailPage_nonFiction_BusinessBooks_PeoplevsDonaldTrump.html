                <h3>Notes From Your Bookseller</h3>
                <p class="bold nonunder">
                    People vs. Donald Trump is a fascinating inside account of the attempt to prosecute 
                    former president Donald Trump, written by one of the lawyers who worked on the 
                    case and resigned in protest when Manhattan’s district attorney refused to act.   
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mark Pomerantz was a retired lawyer living a calm suburban life when he accepted 
                    an unexpected offer to join the staff of the district attorney of New York County in 
                    February 2021 to work on the investigation of former president Donald Trump. The 
                    Manhattan DA was interested in Pomerantz because he brought vast experience in 
                    litigating white collar and organized crime cases, having worked as a federal 
                    prosecutor and a criminal defense attorney for decades. Pomerantz had prosecuted 
                    and defended cases involving murder, drug trafficking, political corruption, tax 
                    evasion, and financial fraud. His clients had included governors and senators, 
                    business leaders, financial institutions, and also gangsters and murderers.        
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the next year, Pomerantz investigated the world of Donald Trump and the 
                    Trump Organization. He interviewed potential witnesses, scrutinized financial 
                    records, and learned everything he could about Trump’s business practices. The 
                    investigation led him to believe that the former president’s approach to business had 
                    much in common with the business practices of another well-known public figure—
                    former mob boss John J. Gotti. Ultimately, Pomerantz gathered enough evidence to 
                    support the view—held by many of his colleagues on the case, including former 
                    Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.—that former president Donald Trump 
                    should be indicted for a number of financial crimes. But that indictment never 
                    happened. This book explains why.        
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pomerantz’s work ultimately led to the indictment of the Trump Organization and 
                    Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, who 
                    pleaded guilty to tax fraud. But that indictment was merely the prelude to a larger 
                    criminal case that Pomerantz urged the Manhattan DA, Alvin Bragg, to bring against 
                    Donald Trump. When the DA refused to authorize that prosecution, Pomerantz and 
                    his colleague Carey Dunne resigned. Aspects of the case Pomerantz wanted to bring 
                    are currently being pursued against Trump by the attorney general of New York 
                    State in a civil fraud case that does not involve criminal penalties.         
                </p>
                <p>
                    In People vs. Donald Trump, Pomerantz tells the story of his unprecedented 
                    investigation, why he believes Donald Trump should be prosecuted, and what we 
                    can learn about the nature of justice in America from this extraordinary case. 
                    Pomerantz draws from a lifetime of legal experience to tell a devastating and 
                    frequently entertaining story of how prosecutors think, how criminals act, and how 
                    our justice system works—and sometimes doesn’t work. Pomerantz has written a 
                    cautionary tale that illuminates the challenges of prosecuting Donald Trump, why 
                    Trump manages to dance between the raindrops of accountability, and how others
                     might bring him to justice.

                    <strong>Mark Pomerantz</strong> was born in Brooklyn and received a BA from Harvard College 
                    in 1972 and a JD from the University of Michigan Law School in 1975. He worked 
                    as a federal prosecutor in the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New 
                    York. Pomerantz has also been on the faculty of Columbia Law School and has 
                    lectured on criminal procedure and white-collar law at Harvard and Stanford Law 
                    Schools. From February 2021 to February 2022, he worked pro bono as special 
                    assistant district attorney in the office of the New York District Attorney Cyrus 
                    Vance Jr. to assist with that office’s criminal investigation into the personal and 
                    business finances of former president Donald Trump.

                    Former federal prosecutor Pomerantz, who came out of retirement to assist Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance’s investigation 
                    into Donald Trump, provides a thorough account of how the inquiry unfolded, and why it was put on hold when a new DA took 
                    office in 2022. Brought onboard in December 2020, Pomerantz worked pro bono to sort through a “long and unfocused laundry list” 
                    of issues identified by Vance and his team, including a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels and “the use of overstated 
                    financial statements and asset valuations” to obtain loans, to determine which, if any, should be prosecuted. He diligently explains 
                    the legal complications involved, including the lack of trustworthy eyewitnesses and “stalling tactics” by Trump. The biggest 
                    stumbling block, however, appears to have been a disagreement between Vance and incoming DA Alvin Bragg about whether the 
                    risk of losing a case against Trump was greater than the need to “vindicate the rule of law.” Pomerantz builds a persuasive argument 
                    in favor of prosecution while acknowledging that Bragg’s tenure would have been “defined and ruined” by a loss. Those hoping for 
                    juicy new details will be largely disappointed, but Pomerantz offers a unique glimpse into white-collar criminal prosecution. It’s an 
                    eye-opening lesson in the many shades of the law. (Feb.)

                        A former federal prosecutor recounts the failed effort to bring charges against Donald Trump.    
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        “Over the months that I and others worked on the case, we developed evidence convincing us that Donald Trump had committed serious 
                        crimes,” writes Pomerantz, who was brought out of retirement to help Manhattan’s district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., investigate financial 
                        misdeeds. The author delivers a deep—and sometimes ponderously detailed—account of what that involved. One point was Trump’s habit 
                        of valuing his properties high for the purposes of bank loans and low for the purposes of paying taxes: Whereas one at 40 Wall St. was 
                        valued at more than $527 million for a lender, Trump valued it at between $16 million and $19 million for taxes. To Pomerantz’s chief 
                        associates, that “looked like fraud” and led the DA’s office to the verge of filing criminal charges. They did not, in part because gaming 
                        numbers is a common ploy in New York real estate circles. On the matter of Michael Cohen’s payout, on Trump’s behalf, of hush money 
                        to Stormy Daniels “so that she would not disclose her alleged affair with Trump on the eve of the 2016 election,” the legal reasoning gets 
                        complicated. The payout becomes illegal only if it’s established that this disclosure is an act of extortion, while the demonstrated falsification 
                        of business records is only a misdemeanor in New York. In the end, the DA went after lesser players, including Cohen and Trump Organization 
                        finance director Allen Weisselberg, both of whom received prison sentences for their crimes. When Vance left office, his successor, to 
                        Pomerantz’s great consternation, dropped the investigation because, the author suggests, he “had scant experience in leading or defending 
                        high-profile prosecutions.” Pomerantz’s dour conclusion for the moment is that “once again, Donald Trump had managed to dance 
                        between the raindrops of accountability.” Yet, he adds, there are other legal avenues to take, so stay tuned.
