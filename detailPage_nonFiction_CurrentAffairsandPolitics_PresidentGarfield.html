                <p>
                    This is a remarkable, illuminating debut biography of the 20th President of the 
                    United States. As C.W. Goodyear ably demonstrates in this expansive and 
                    penetrating work, James Abram Garfield was a pivotal, perceptive leader at a 
                    critical, precarious and politically contentious time in our nation’s history. History 
                    readers are in for a treat.

                    An “ambitious, thorough, supremely researched” (The Washington Post) biography

                    In “the most comprehensive Garfield biography in almost fifty years” (The Wall 
                    Street Journal), C.W. Goodyear charts the life and times of one of the most 
                    remarkable Americans ever to win the Presidency. Progressive firebrand and 
                    conservative compromiser; Union war hero and founder of the first Department of 
                    Education; Supreme Court attorney and abolitionist preacher; mathematician and 
                    canalman; crooked election-fixed and clean-government champion; Congressional 
                    chieftain and gentleman-farmer; the last president to be born in a log cabin; the 
                    second to be assassinated. James Abram Garfield was all these things and more.

                    Over nearly two decades in Congress during a polarized era—Reconstruction and 
                    the Gilded Age—Garfield served as a peacemaker in a Republican Party and America 
                    defined by divisions. He was elected to overcome them. He was killed while trying 
                    to do so.

                <p>
                    President Garfield is American history at its finest. It is about an impoverished boy 
                    working his way from the frontier to the Presidency; a progressive statesman, trying 
                    to raise a more righteous, peaceful Republic out of the ashes of civil war; the 
                    tragically imperfect course of that reformation, and the man himself; a martyr-
                    President, whose death succeeded in nudging the country back to cleaner, calmer 
                    politics.

                    Historian Goodyear debuts with a sturdy biography of President James Garfield. Born in 1831 in Ohio (“the last American president to begin 
                    life in a log cabin,” Goodyear notes), Garfield turned a hard-won education into a teaching career. He soon became head of the Hiram Eclectic 
                    Institute and was elected to the state senate as pre–Civil War tensions intensified. When war broke out, Garfield led a regiment made up of his 
                    students, parlaying military success into a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, where he would serve for more than a decade. Thanks to
                     his ability to bring together rival Republican factions, Garfield secured the party’s presidential nomination in 1880. Drawing connections
                     between the circumstances of Garfield’s rise and the modern day, Goodyear notes that Garfield’s predecessor, Rutherford B. Hayes, who
                     lost the popular vote and became president in a backroom deal, was “widely considered illegitimate.” Garfield was in his first year of 
                    office when he was shot by “a frustrated office-seeker” from his own party; he would slowly die of infection over months. Goodyear
                    provides a thorough complement to previous biographies, which tended to focus more on the legacy of Garfield’s murder than on his 
                    life. This fresh appraisal sheds new light on the history of American political polarity. (July)

                        himself up by his bootstraps, fought as a general in the Civil War, rose to leadership in postwar Congresses, challenged the tawdry politics of the 
                        Gilded Age, and suffered martyrdom by assassination that launched the beginnings of the end of the system that killed him. Goodyear's lucid 
                        prose disentangles the complexities and ambiguities of this story."

                        Historian Goodyear reviews aspects of the life of James Abram Garfield (1831–1881), who was born in a log-cabin in Ohio and became a 
                        scholar, an ordained Disciples of Christ minister, a college president, a Civil War general, a congressman, a lawyer, and the United States' 20th 
                        president (the second one to be assassinated). The author includes, but does not lengthily discuss, some unflattering facts. For example, there's
                         mention of how Garfield tricked the Indigenous Salish tribe out of their land in the Pacific Northwest on behalf of the federal government, 
                        and there are details about an extramarital affair. A great deal of the narrative focuses on Garfield's wartime years, including his friendship 
                        with the Catholic convert Gen. William Starke Rosecrans, who widened Garfield's religious outlook. As president, Garfield intended to 
                        reform civil service, which wouldn't happen until the administration of his successor, Chester A. Arthur. Perhaps too many pages are 
                        devoted to Garfield's end-of-life medical mistreatment; on this, Candice Millard's Destiny of the Republic is the more focused presentation.
                         VERDICT Despite its engaging flowery prose, perhaps inspired by the literary aspects of Garfield's diaries, this book's length might 
                        attract only serious scholars. General readers may want to consider Benjamin Arrington's The Last Lincoln Republican.

                        In his debut book, Washington, D.C.–based historian Goodyear chronicles the life of James Garfield (1831-1881). In the
                        acknowledgments, the author describes himself as “an embarrassingly starstruck” admirer of renowned biographer Edmund 
                       Morris, and his vividly descriptive style, buttressed by an exhaustive use of primary and secondary sources, effectively echoes 
                       the approach and prose in Morris' brilliant trilogy of the life of Theodore Roosevelt. Goodyear relates his subject’s life in
                        fascinating, comprehensive detail, from his remarkable climb from onerous poverty in what was known as the Ohio Western
                        Reserve to college president, state legislator, brigadier, major general in the Civil War, U.S. congressman, and president
                        and his relationship with his indispensably patient, tolerant, and loving wife, Lucretia, whom Garfield labeled 
                       "unstampedable." The author displays a smooth aptitude for the complex postwar political workings of 19th-century
                        machine politics and internecine Republican Party patronage squabbles, and he ably explores Garfield's relationships 
                       and tussles with the likes of James Blaine, Roscoe Conkling, and Conkling's lieutenant, Chester Arthur. Goodyear 
                       describes Garfield’s remarkably even, conciliatory deportment, which made him a friend to nearly all in his various 
                       stations and won him the 1880 Republican presidential nomination. He also offers a gripping account of a deranged 
                       office seeker's attack that would eventually end the president’s life and how his legacy helped foster comity and reform
                        in American politics and government. Goodyear's invaluable biography breaks Garfield free from the group of 
                       late-19th-century presidents seemingly crystallized as interchangeable, bearded figures occupying the first chair of a 
                       weakened executive branch and offers a compelling profile of one of the ablest men to serve as president.
