                    Of course, her new roommate Frederick J. Fitzwilliam is far from normal. He sleeps 
                    all day, is out at night on business, and talks like he walked out of a regency 
                    romance novel. He also leaves Cassie heart-melting notes around the apartment, 
                    cares about her art, and asks about her day. And he doesn’t look half bad shirtless, 
                    on the rare occasions they’re both home and awake. But when Cassie finds bags of 
                    blood in the fridge that definitely weren’t there earlier, Frederick has to come 
                    clean...

                <p>
                    Cassie’s sexy new roommate is a vampire. And he has a proposition for her.

                    Levine debuts with this lighthearted and charming paranormal rom-com. Aspiring artist Cassie is suspicious of the too-good-to-be-true 
                    Chicago apartment listing she finds online—but with eviction looming, she’s low on options. She takes the room, moving in with the 
                    apartment’s oddly old-fashioned owner, Frederick J. Fitzwilliam. As strange and out of touch as Frederick seems, he’s also rich, considerate, 
                    wildly handsome, and a gentleman. Cassie works during the day while Frederick claims to be out of the apartment “on business” most nights, 
                    so the pair communicate largely through sweet (and increasingly flirtatious) notes. Cassie’s not looking to complicate their living situation, 
                    but she can’t deny how much she enjoys their dynamic—until the night she ducks home unexpectedly and discovers Frederick slurping from 
                    a blood bag. Frederick is a vampire, he’s been in a coma for a hundred years, and he wants Cassie’s help getting up to speed on the modern 
                    world before his old flame Esmeralda shows up demanding they pick up where they left off. This adorable odd couple proves easy to root for, 
                    with Frederick’s awkwardness navigating modern life adding both humor and pathos. The supernatural conflict wraps up a bit too smoothly, 
                    but there’s so much fun to be had that readers won’t mind. This one is good to the last drop. Agent Kim Lionetti, Bookends. (Aug.)

                    <span>"Jenna Levine's sensational debut has everything I want in a romcom - delightfully wry humour, a warm heart, and an utterly adorable romance 
                    with the most dreamy hero ever to don a cravat. My Roommate Is a Vampire is altogether a kooky, sparkly piece of happiness."
                    —India Holton, national bestselling author of The League of Gentlewomen Witches</span>
                    
                    <span>“Jenna Levine delivers a fresh, charming romp full of heart and some of the best kissing scenes I’ve ever read. For someone whose love for both 
                    vampires and Chicago runs deep, it was an absolute delight of a novel to sink my teeth into.”
                    —Isabel Cañas, national bestselling author of The Hacienda</span>
                    
                    <span>"My Roommate Is a Vampire is a delicious, delightful love story - whimsical, magical, and hilarious, with enough heart to make readers cry and 
                    enough heat to make them melt. It's an ode to love in all its forms - romantic love, but also the love of friends, the love of art, and the process of 
                    learning to love yourself. Cassie is warm-hearted, chaotically horny, and so relatable, and Frederick J. Fitzwiliam is the exquisitely dressed 
                    cinnamon roll vampire of my dreams. This is an incredible debut, and I can't wait to read whatever story Levine tells next!"
                    —Sarah Hawley, author of A Witch’s Guide to Fake Dating a Demon</span>
                    
                    <span>"If the world is against Frederick J. Fitzwilliam, then I am against the world. Wildly entertaining, delightfully steamy, laugh-out-loud hilarious, 
                    wrenchingly romantic, Levine's debut folds a charming cast of characters into a deftly written supernatural love story for the ages. Don't miss the 
                    chance to sink your teeth into this!"—Thea Guanzon, author of The Hurricane Wars</span>
                    
                    <span>"My Roommate Is a Vampire is a breezy, clever romp that will leave you laughing so loud you could wake the undead. Jenna Levine is a

                        DEBUT Finding a suspiciously perfect Craigslist ad seeking a roommate for a bargain-priced apartment in a great Chicago neighborhood 
                        that's located between her two jobs is just the boost that Cassie Greenberg needs. She won't even be around much to disturb her new roommate, 
                        between leading art programs at the library and working as a barista in the evenings. There must be a catch, but even meeting 
                        Frederick J. Fitzwilliam one evening and getting a tour of his uniquely decorated apartment isn't enough to sway her against the idea. 
                        His peculiar dress and manner of speaking are more intriguing than anything, so Cassie moves in. Mysterious signs start indicating that 
                        Frederick is keeping a secret from Cassie, but he seems to genuinely admire her and supports her art. One fateful evening after arriving 
                        home early, Cassie finds their refrigerator filled with bags of blood, which causes Frederick to confess his truth, but also that he needs 
                        her help to survive. VERDICT This humorous debut from Levine is perfect for readers who enjoy the roommates-to-romance trope and 
                        a dash of sexy vampire.—Jenna Harmison

                        A down-on-her-luck artist discovers her new roommate is a 300-year-old vampire.

                        Cassie Greenberg barely makes a living from her cobbled-together part-time jobs, her art incorporating trash and recycled items is too 
                        avant-garde to be successful, and she has just been evicted from her Chicago apartment. When she sees a Craigslist ad for a room rental in 
                        Lincoln Park for only $200 a month, she contacts the owner even though she’s sure there must be a catch. Frederick J. Fitzwilliam, 
                        her stunningly handsome new roommate, is a bit of an oddball: His clothes and mannerisms are too formal, he sleeps all day, and he seems 
                        completely unaware of how the modern world works. Who doesn’t have Wi-Fi or prefer texting in this day and age! Cassie mostly works 
                        when Frederick is sleeping, so they strike up a flirtatious friendship through handwritten notes. When Cassie arrives home early from work 
                        one day, she discovers the fridge is full of blood and realizes that Frederick is a vampire. He recently awoke from a centurylong coma and 
                        realized that finding a human roommate might help him learn the ropes of the 21st century. The two strike up a tentative friendship, and 
                        Cassie agrees to teach Frederick how to navigate the modern world, including using public transportation, ordering drinks at the coffee shop, 
                        and shopping for clothes at the mall. It’s a cute setup, one full of potential, but the plot and characters are shallow and underdeveloped. Cassie 
                        and Frederick settle into a tame, conflict-free relationship. The details about Frederick’s history and the supernatural world are thin and full of 
                        omissions, leaving so many unanswered questions that the book almost feels unfinished.

                        Gilli Messer gives voice to both a modern 30-something artist and a 350-year-old vampire in this romantic comedy. Cassie is being evicted and 
                        needs a place to stay right away. She answers an ad for a roommate--even though the rent is suspiciously low for a Chicago apartment with a 
                        lake view. Frederick J. Fitzwilliam has spent the last hundred years in the vampire equivalent of a coma, and he needs some human help fitting 
                        into the 21st century. As Messer portrays sweet, respectful, and hapless Frederick, the chemistry between him and Cassie is palpable. As Cassie 
                        teaches him how to buy clothes and ride the "L," her own life starts to fall into place, too. Overall, though, the audiobook doesn't live up to its 
                        fun premise. J.M.D. © AudioFile 2023, Portland, Maine
