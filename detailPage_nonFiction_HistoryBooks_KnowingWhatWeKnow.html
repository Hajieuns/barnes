                    anyone you encounter . . . . Simon Winchester has firmly earned his place in 
                    history . . . as a promulgator of knowledge of every variety, perhaps the last of the 
                    famous explorers who crisscrossed the now-vanished British Empire and reported 
                    what they found to an astonished world.”  — New York Times
                    From the creation of the first encyclopedia to Wikipedia, from ancient museums to 
                    modern kindergarten classes—this is award winning writer Simon Winchester’s

                    With the advent of the internet, any topic we want to know about is instantly 
                    available with the touch of a smartphone button. With so much knowledge at our 
                    fingertips, what is there left for our brains to do? At a time when we seem to be 
                    stripping all value from the idea of knowing things—no need for math, no need for 
                    map-reading, no need for memorization—are we risking our ability to think? As we 
                    empty our minds, will we one day be incapable of thoughtfulness?            
                </p>
                <p>
                    Addressing these questions, Simon Winchester explores how humans have attained, 
                    stored, and disseminated knowledge. Examining such disciplines as education, 
                    journalism, encyclopedia creation, museum curation, photography, and 
                    broadcasting, he looks at a whole range of knowledge diffusion—from the 
                    cuneiform writings of Babylon to the machine-made genius of artificial intelligence, 
                    by way of Gutenberg, Google, and Wikipedia to the huge Victorian assemblage of 
                    the Mundanaeum, the collection of everything ever known, currently stored in a 
                    damp basement in northern Belgium.

                    Studded with strange and fascinating details, Knowing What We Know is a deep 
                    dive into learning and the human mind. Throughout this fascinating tour, 
                    Winchester forces us to ponder what rational humans are becoming. What good is 
                    all this knowledge if it leads to lack of thought? What is information without 
                    wisdom? Does Rene Descartes’s Cogito, ergo sum—“I think therefore I am,” the 
                    foundation for human knowledge widely accepted since the Enlightenment—still 
                    hold?         
                </p>
                <p>
                    And what will the world be like if no one in it is wise?

                <span>
                    Winchester’s erudite and discursive latest history (after Land) aims “to tell the story of how knowledge has been passed from its vast passel of 
                    sources into the equally vast variety of human minds, and how the means of its passage have evolved over the thousands of years of human 
                    existence.” He begins with a thorough examination of the very concept of knowledge, from its first recorded appearance (spelled cnawlece) in 
                    the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles of 963 CE to T.S. Eliot’s 1934 play The Rock, which today’s information scientists view as a key touchstone in 
                    the modern theory of knowledge. From there, Winchester examines the education of children; sites of knowledge, including libraries and 
                    museums; formats for dispensing information, such as books, photographs, television, and the internet; types of manipulation, including 
                    propaganda and public relations; devices that assist human knowledge (calculators, GPS, artificial intelligence); and geniuses and polymaths 
                    like 11th-century Chinese scholar Shen Gua, who realized “the usefulness of the magnetic compass,” and 19th-century British Army soldier 
                    James Beale, “a prescient campaigner for pan-African freedom.” Though Winchester gathers fascinating and varied examples from throughout 
                    history and around the world, they don’t necessarily add up to a cohesive thesis. Still, it’s a stimulating cabinet of wonders. Photos. (Apr.)

                        A study of the problematic nature of wisdom.

                    <span>
                        Prolific historian Winchester brings his insatiable curiosity to a wide-ranging examination of how humans have acquired, retained, and passed on 
                        knowledge from ancient times to the information-saturated present. Drawing on abundant research and autobiographical reflections on personal 
                        experiences of learning, the author creates an engaging narrative populated by a vast array of individuals, including philosophers, religious figures,
                         polymaths, inventors, and researchers from all over the world: Confucius and Aristotle, Charles Babbage and Thomas Babington Macaulay; Larry
                         Page, Sergey Brin, and Tim Berners-Lee, to name a few. Winchester examines the development of writing systems, the evolution of scrolls into 
                        books, and the various innovations for storing knowledge that have taken the form of encyclopedias, libraries, and museums. He considers the 
                        impacts of the inventions of paper, the printing press, and newspapers as well as the spread of misinformation and suppression of information 
                        by governments or political factions. Not surprisingly, he devotes much attention to computers, first demonstrated to an amazed public in 1968; 
                        the invention of hypertext; the founding of the World Wide Web; the release of Wikipedia in 2001; and the strides being made in artificial 
                        intelligence. Winchester’s overriding concern is the future of thinking: “If machines will acquire all our knowledge for us and do our thinking
                         for us, then what, pray, is the need for us to be?” If GPS makes map-reading an antiquated skill, if Wikipedia makes retaining information 
                        unnecessary, if calculators do our math problems, what happens to the capacity of our minds? “How, in sum, do we value the knowledge 
                        that, thanks to the magic of electronics, is now cast before us in so vast and ceaseless and unstoppable a cascade?” asks the author. “Amid
                         the torrent and its fury, what is to become of thought—care and calm and quiet thoughtfulness? What of our own chance of ever gaining 
                        wisdom? Do we need it?”

                        A book about transmitting knowledge by someone who has made his name by doing just that in the most erudite and entertaining way possible….
                        a delightful compendium of the kind of facts you immediately want to share with anyone you encounter . . . . Simon Winchester has firmly earned 
                        his place in history . . . as a promulgator of knowledge of every variety, perhaps the last of the famous explorers who crisscrossed the now-vanished
                         British Empire and reported what they found to an astonished world . . . .” — New York Times

                        illiteracy to the wisdom of the hour, artificial intelligence . . . . Winchester is adroit at arranging information in pursuit of knowledge, and he has 
                        an eye for the anecdote . . . . Winchester is a knowledge keeper for our times, and he does us all a service by writing it down.” — Wall Street Journal

                        own era. Whatever his subject, Winchester leavens deep research and the crisp factual writing of a reporter . . . with an abundance of curious 
                        anecdotes, footnotes and digressions. His prose is always clear, but it is also invigorated with pleasingly elegant diction. . . . He is a pleasure to
                         read, or even to listen to, as devotees of his audiobooks can testify. . . . Informative and entertaining throughout.”

                        "Winchester has written about information systems before, as in his 1998 book The Professor and the Madman, about the making of the Oxford 
                        English Dictionary. In his robust new compendium, the author examines those systems in far grander scope, from mankind’s earliest attempts at
                         language to the digital worlds we now keep in our pockets. This isn’t just a rollicking look back; Winchester asks what these systems do to our 
                        minds, for good and ill." — Los Angeles Times

                        stimulates intellectual curiosity . . . . One of the delights of Knowing What We Know is Winchester’s skill at character sketches of figures who almost
                         certainly aren’t familiar to the general reader, but who nonetheless he considers vital contributors to the advancement of human knowledge."

                        Few author/narrators sound as richly knowledgeable as Simon Winchester, the prolific British popular historian whose cosmopolitan voice has 
                        distinguished more than two dozen of his audiobooks on that many different subjects. Here he addresses the subject of knowledge itself--how 
                        knowledge has been transmitted and received over the centuries. Vast as that topic might sound, Winchester's focus is always specific and insightful,
                         especially when he tracks the spread of the news of the Krakatoa volcano eruption in 1883 or the endurance--and sometimes suppression--of several
                         iconic news photos. Winchester is not just the best narrator of his own work, he is also unequaled in his ease, grace, erudition, and a engthy list of
                         other outstanding attributes. D.A.W. Winner of AudioFile Earphones Award © AudioFile 2023, Portland, Maine
