                    In recent years, the high-profile murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and so 
                    many others have brought much-needed attention to the pervasiveness of police 
                    misconduct. Yet it remains nearly impossible to hold police accountable for abuses 
                    of power—the decisions of the Supreme Court, state and local governments, and 
                    policy makers have, over decades, made the police all but untouchable.

                    In Shielded, University of California, Los Angeles, law professor Joanna Schwartz 
                    exposes the myriad ways in which our legal system protects police at all costs, with 
                    insightful analyses about subjects ranging from qualified immunity to no-knock 
                    warrants. The product of more than two decades of advocacy and research, Shielded 
                    is a timely and necessary investigation into why civil rights litigation so rarely leads 
                    to justice or prevents future police misconduct. Weaving powerful true stories of 
                    people seeking restitution for violated rights, cutting across race, gender, criminal 
                    history, tax bracket, and zip code, Schwartz paints a compelling picture of the 
                    human cost of our failing criminal justice system, bringing clarity to a problem that 
                    is widely known but little understood. Shielded is a masterful work of immediate 
                    and enduring consequence, revealing what tragically familiar calls for “justice” truly 
                    entail.

                    An intricate web of laws, policies, and customs protects U.S. police officers even when they abuse their power, according to this searing 
                    indictment. UCLA law professor Schwartz (coauthor, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure) casts a harsh light on nearly every aspect of the 
                    justice system, from Supreme Court decisions to federal juries that “disproportionately exclude people of color, poor people, people 
                    with criminal records, and people who have had negative experiences with the police.” According to Schwartz, the strongest police 
                    protection is qualified immunity, which shields officers from being sued for monetary damages even if they’ve violated the Constitution.
                     Debunking the claim that if officers faced threats of litigation and bankruptcy for split-second mistakes, no one would serve in law 
                    enforcement, Schwartz notes that in 44 of America’s largest police jurisdictions, taxpayers carried the financial burden for 99.98% 
                    of settlements and judgments awarded to victims of police misconduct. (The city of Chicago paid almost half a billion dollars in such
                     lawsuits between 2010 and 2020.) The author’s solutions include requiring officers to pay a portion of settlements entered against 
                    them, and better educating the public about the failures of the criminal justice system. Rigorous research, in-depth analysis, and 
                    poignant case studies make this a must-read study of an urgent social issue. (Feb.)

                        "Schwartz maintains that while the concern that ‘public safety will be imperiled by too much oversight’ has always accompanied 
                        the desire to hold the police accountable, it is now nearly an unquestioned assumption that lawsuits against the police exact too 
                        high a price. . . . But this assumption, Schwartz contends, is a myth that has distorted the civil justice system by persuading judges
                         of the need to insulate the police from accountability.

                       address it, in our nation, our state, and our cities.

                        for police violence and misconduct in our country. By unsparingly sharing the stories of just a few of the innocent victims 
                       whose lives have been devastated by police violence, Schwartz reveals how the civil rights legal regime designed to provide
                        recourse to individuals subjected to unwarranted state violence has been disabled by more than a century of restrictive 
                       judicial decision-making and lawmaker inaction. Once you understand how we got here, Schwartz’s smart, pragmatic 
                       proposals for change ring clear and true.”

                        remains elusive for those whose lives have been shattered by police violence. Cutting through polemics and 
                       misinformation, Shielded is both a searing indictment of our current system and a clear-eyed roadmap for change.
                        This is a profound and indispensable work that will shape the national

                        how can we change this system? Full of human stories, detailed data, and powerful arguments, Shielded will 
                        answer these urgent questions and should be on the reading list of every legislator, policymaker, and ordinary

                         Schwartz takes aim at the profound flaws in how we deal with police violence, showing the ways in which our 
                        judiciary is designed to fail the most vulnerable among us—and how another way forward is possible.”

                        problem. This book is an essential tool for addressing one of the country's most pressing and wrenching problems.”

                        accountability that police officers are largely indifferent to lawsuits, victims are only rarely compensated, and
                         abuse continues. A devastating critique that demands our attention.”

                        A legal scholar examines how American police forces protect themselves from accountability in instances of abuse or misconduct.         
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        Because police officers must make instant life-and-death decisions in the name of protecting the public from harm,
                        mistakes are inevitable. However, police are rarely prosecuted as harshly, or even fairly, as everyday citizens. 
                       As UCLA law professor Schwartz shows in this accessible study, when police officers make decisions that lead 
                       to avoidable harm, “there should be meaningful accountability for law enforcement officers and officials, and
                        justice for their victims.” Indeed, she adds, while those cases illustrate police overreach and undeniable abuse
                        of power, it is qualified immunity—the ability to evade punishment through legal protections of any action
                        committed in the line of duty—that “has come to represent all that is wrong with our system of police 
                       accountability.” An irony, perhaps, is that the policies and shields enacted by local governments—and 
                       there are thousands of them across the country—effectively keep those governments from controlling 
                       the police they employ. Those who resist calls for an end to qualified community, Schwartz notes, often 
                       claim that opening the police to lawsuits over misconduct or abuse would bankrupt communities. Yet,
                        she adds, “it is indemnification rules, not qualified immunity, that shield officers’ bank accounts.” 
                       In this astute, well-researched account, the author establishes that such lawsuits account for less than 1%
                        of the budgets of local governments, even as maintaining police forces accounts for 30%-40% of those 
                       budgets. Moreover, she adds, there are already safeguards against the misuse of the courts in such lawsuits,
                        including established law that holds that “officers do not violate the Constitution if they act reasonably 
                       from the perspective of an officer on the scene,” which certainly would not have been the case in the 
                       matters of Trayvon Martin or Michael Floyd or George Floyd or Breonna Taylor or countless others.
