                    There may be no tidy solutions or pithy answers to life’s big challenges, but Michelle

                    navigate change and remain steady within flux. In The Light We Carry, she opens a 
                    frank and honest dialogue with readers, considering the questions many of us 
                    wrestle with: How do we build enduring and honest relationships? How can we 
                    discover strength and community inside our differences? What tools do we use to 
                    address feelings of self-doubt or helplessness? What do we do when it all starts to 
                    feel like too much?

                    Michelle Obama offers readers a series of fresh stories and insightful reflections on 
                    change, challenge, and power, including her belief that when we light up for others, 
                    we can illuminate the richness and potential of the world around us, discovering 
                    deeper truths and new pathways for progress. Drawing from her experiences as a 
                    mother, daughter, spouse, friend, and First Lady, she shares the habits and principles 
                    she has developed to successfully adapt to change and overcome various obstacles—
                    the earned wisdom that helps her continue to “become.” She details her most 
                    valuable practices, like “starting kind,” “going high,” and assembling a “kitchen 
                    table” of trusted friends and mentors. With trademark humor, candor, and 
                    compassion, she also explores issues connected to race, gender, and visibility, 
                    encouraging readers to work through fear, find strength in community, and live 
                    with boldness.

                    “When we are able to recognize our own light, we become empowered to use it,” 
                    writes Michelle Obama. A rewarding blend of powerful stories and profound advice 
                    that will ignite conversation, The Light We Carry inspires readers to examine their 
                    own lives, identify their sources of gladness, and connect meaningfully in a turbulent 
                    world.

                <p>
                    <strong>Michelle Obama</strong> served as First Lady of the United States from 2009 to 2017. A 
                    graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law School, Mrs. Obama started her 
                    career as an attorney at the Chicago law firm Sidley & Austin, where she met her 
                    future husband, Barack Obama. She later worked in the Chicago mayor’s office, at 
                    the University of Chicago, and at the University of Chicago Medical Center. Mrs. 
                    Obama also founded the Chicago chapter of Public Allies, an organization that 
                    prepares young people for careers in public service. She is the author of the #1 
                    global bestseller Becoming and the #1 national bestseller American Grown. The 
                    Obamas currently live in Washington, D.C., and have two daughters, Malia and 
                    Sasha.

                    Obama needs no introduction, but that doesn't mean her second book, after The Light We Carry, won't surprise readers. From her 
                    reflections on pain in the introduction all the way through the final answers readers will be delighted to discover on the last page, 
                    she has crafted a powerful narrative as much about her insecurities and struggles as it is about the strength she's found through 
                    people in her life. She writes of intersectionality, hope, and fear—at an individual and systemic level—and the supportive 
                    relationships that have served her well through everything, from her time in the White House through the isolation and trauma 
                    of the COVID pandemic. She also shares glimpses of what parenting looks like in her family, how relationships evolve, and 
                    the strategies that have helped her become "armored yet agile," a trait more necessary now, perhaps, than ever before. Not 
                    a word is wasted; not a sentiment feels out of place or inauthentic. VERDICT This is wisdom, pure and simple, for everyone in 
                    search of the strength necessary to live expansive lives in a world that too often relegates people to the margins.—Emily Bowles

                        A heartening pep talk from the former first lady.
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        Obama's previous book, Becoming, was the bestselling book of 2018, translated into 24 languages and embraced around the world—
                        not only because the author was already beloved and admired, but because the memoir shared the details of a unique, impressive life 
                        story. This follow-up is the kind of book that gets published because everyone wants more, whether or not there actually is any more 
                        to say. Inspired by roundtable discussions with young women and college students—and by questions asked on her arena book tour—
                        Obama recapitulates and expands her guiding beliefs, giving us "a glimpse inside my personal toolbox…what I use professionally and 
                        personally to help me stay balanced and confident, what keeps me moving forward even during times of high anxiety and stress." 
                        We've heard before about the author's experiences as a Black woman at Princeton; the inspiring example of her father; the importance 
                        of friendship in her life; the early days of her relationship with her husband; and the decision to move her down-to-earth mother to the 
                        White House. She returns to those topics here, this time focusing less on storytelling than on crystallizing advice for those dealing with 
                        experiences of otherness, prejudice, "not-mattering" and loneliness (12% of Americans say they have no friends at all!). The author 
                        strongly believes our weaknesses can fuel our strengths, offering the example of inaugural poet Amanda Gorman’s overcoming her 
                        speech impediment. Toward the end of the book, Obama addresses the idea she's become most famous for "going high," first articulated 
                        at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. "But have you seen the world lately?" people ask her, after all the miseries and outrages 
                        of the last several years. "Are we stillsupposed to be going high?" Read the book to find out.

                        No surprises or reveals but plenty of warmth and encouragement, particularly for young people. A good holiday gift.

                    <span>
                        “Reaffirming . . . What makes the book special is that it builds on parts of Becoming, and [Michelle] Obama serves as mentor 
                        and guide.”—The Washington Post

                        “Obama’s road map for uncertain times resonates in ways that other self-help books do not. . . . Through her stories, experiences

                        “Miraculously, these self-help bromides don’t come across as cloying, mainly because Obama is so disarmingly honest about her 
                        fears, failures and all-too-human flaws. . . . You can’t argue with the hard-fought wisdom of such an accomplished woman.”—The Guardian

                    <span>
                        “Though Obama makes it clear she still struggles with plenty of self-doubt and doesn’t have all the answers, she provides a pretty 
                        thorough road map to living a fuller, kinder, better life.”—USA Today

                        “In The Light We Carry, Obama shares ideas for quelling what roils our stomachs and ways to move forward. She’s like a big sister

                        “A serious work of candid reflection by a singular figure of early-twenty-first-century America . . . Becoming is refined and

                    <span>
                        “Becoming is inspirational without trying to be. From the first words, the very warmth that permeates its author emanates from 
                        the pages. . . . Becoming manages to be a coming-of-age tale, a love story and a family saga all in one. More importantly, this book 
                        is a reminder that America is still a work-in-progress, and that hope can be an action word if we allow it to be. Becoming is a balm 
                        that America needs, from a woman America does not yet deserve.”—Angie Thomas, Time

                        “Deeply personal and refreshingly honest . . . She’s thoughtful, humorous, bracingly revealing, and when it’s time, she does us all the 
                        favor of showing us the human side of a man worshipped by so many. . . . It’s human and genuine and welcoming to see the layers of 
                        humanity she holds open. . . . Michelle Obama’s story can maybe inspire you to find a path for your own story.”

                        Michelle Obama performs the follow-up to her bestselling memoir, BECOMING, giving listeners another peek at her life. This time, 
                        Obama aims to inspire listeners to become their best selves, giving practical advice and using illustrations from her own life. Her 
                        deeply personal stories show listeners how she has worked her way through obstacles. Listeners also learn more about Obama’s 
                        life post-White House and hear about how her family weathered the pandemic. Her warm, inviting voice sounds like she’s sitting 
                        down with listeners at the kitchen table, sharing words of encouragement. What’s more, Obama creates a lovely sense of kindness 
                        and emotional intimacy that make listeners feel hopeful and ready to go out and face our chaotic world. K.D.W. Winner of
