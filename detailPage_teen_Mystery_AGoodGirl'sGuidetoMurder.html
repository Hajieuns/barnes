                        Five years prior to this book’s start, 17-year-old Andie Bell disappeared from the small town of Fairview, Conn. Her body was never found, but her 
                        boyfriend, Salil Singh, was blamed for her murder after he texted a confession to his father and died from an apparent suicide. High school senior 
                        Pippa Fitz-Amobi remembers how kind Sal was, and she thinks he may have been innocent; via her senior project, she aims to prove it. Though Pip,
                         an adept snoop, is forbidden from contacting the victims’ families, Sal’s younger brother, Ravi, insists on helping, and Pip begins interviewing anyone
                         who might have information about the spring night Andie went missing. Pip assumes they’re on the right track when she starts to receive threatening 
                        notes that place her in the crosshairs of someone determined to keep a dark secret. Jackson sprinkles the fast-paced narrative with Pip’s notes, project 
                        logs, and interview transcripts—as well as several cleverly placed red herrings— while exploring how the Singh and Bell families suffered in the aftermath 
                        of the alleged crime. Jackson caps her suspenseful, well-plotted mystery with a few twists that readers likely won’t see coming. Fans of Veronica Mars and
                         its ilk will find plenty to enjoy in Jackson’s assured debut. Ages 14–up. Agent: Tracy Phillips, Egmont UK. (Feb.)

                        Gr 9 Up—Five years ago, Andie Bell disappeared; she was believed to be murdered and her body hidden by her boyfriend Sal Singh before taking his 
                        own life. Pippa (Pip) Fitz-Amobi believes Sal is innocent and that he was murdered, and sets out to prove it for her senior capstone project. The deeper 
                        she digs into the truth, the more trouble Pip finds herself in. Somebody out there doesn't want her discovering the truth of what happened to Andie, and
                         it may just be the real person responsible. Jackson's debut is a captivating mystery that will have readers hooked. Some may find the pacing at the 
                        beginning a little slow but it doesn't take long for the story to pick up. The majority of the characters, including Pip, are intriguing and well developed, 
                        containing flaws that make them more realistic. While Pip herself is white, there is a diverse cast of characters overall, including Sal and his brother Ravi, 
                        the latter playing a major role in helping Pip find answers. Pip's capstone project is interwoven with the third-person narration, so readers are allowed 
                        access to her thoughts and work even though she isn't directly telling the story. Jackson wonderfully crafts the mystery so that readers can create their 
                        own hypotheses as Pip puts the pieces together—but they won't find out the truth until she does. VERDICT A wonderful addition to any library

                        Pip has known and liked Sal since childhood; he'd supported her when she was being bullied in middle school. For her senior capstone project, Pip 
                        researches the disappearance of former Fairview High student Andie, last seen on April 18, 2014, by her younger sister, Becca. The original investigation
                         concluded with most of the evidence pointing to Sal, who was found dead in the woods, apparently by suicide. Andie's body was never recovered, and Sal
                         was assumed by most to be guilty of abduction and murder. Unable to ignore the gaps in the case, Pip sets out to prove Sal's innocence, beginning with
                         interviewing his younger brother, Ravi. With his help, Pip digs deeper, unveiling unsavory facts about Andie and the real reason Sal's friends couldn't
                         provide him with an alibi. But someone is watching, and Pip may be in more danger than she realizes. Pip's sleuthing is both impressive and accessible. 
                        Online articles about the case and interview transcripts are provided throughout, and Pip's capstone logs offer insights into her thought processes as new 
                        evidence and suspects arise. Jackson's debut is well-executed and surprises readers with a connective web of interesting characters and motives. 
                        Pip and Andie are white, and Sal is of Indian descent.
