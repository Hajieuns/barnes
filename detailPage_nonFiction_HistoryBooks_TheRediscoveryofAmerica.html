                    Distinguished scholar and historian, Ned Blackhawk urges a conversation-shifting 
                    change in our historical perspective — one that places Indigenous history front, 
                    center and essential to the accurate rendering of America’s fuller story. Blackhawk’s 
                    book sets a new paradigm.

                    “In accounts of American history, Indigenous peoples are often treated as largely

                    arc of nation-building. Blackhawk . . . [shows] that Native communities have, 
                    instead, been inseparable from the American story all along.”—Washington Post

                    Ned Blackhawk interweaves five centuries of Native and non‑Native histories, from 
                    Spanish colonial exploration to the rise of Native American self-determination in the

                    Blackhawk’s retelling of U.S. history acknowledges the enduring power, agency, and

                    “American Indians were central to every century of U.S. historical development,” argues Yale historian Blackhawk (Violence over the Land) 
                    in this sweeping study. He begins with the arrival of Spanish explorers in Mexico and Florida in the 16th century, before shifting to French 
                    and British colonization efforts in the Northeast and the Ohio River Valley. In both instances, Native communities endured extreme violence 
                    and devastating epidemics, while employing fluid survival strategies (fighting, relocating, converting to Christianity, trading, intermarrying) 
                    that influenced imperial ambitions and behavior. Blackhawk also makes a persuasive case that in the wake of the Seven Years’ War and the 
                    expulsion of French forces from the interior of North America, “the growing allegiances between British and Indian leaders became valuable 
                    fodder in colonists’ critiques of their monarch,” helping to lead to the Revolutionary War. In Blackhawk’s telling, “Indian affairs” remained 
                    a potent political and social issue through the Civil War, Reconstruction, and the New Deal and Cold War eras, as the removal of more than 
                    75,000 Native children to federally funded boarding schools between the 1870s and 1920s and the dispossession of nearly a hundred million
                     acres of reservation land during the same time period gave rise to a new generation of activists whose efforts to regain Native autonomy 
                    reshaped U.S. law and culture. Striking a masterful balance between the big picture and crystal-clear snapshots of key people and events, 
                    this is a vital new understanding of American history. (Apr.)

                        A Western Shoshone and professor of history and American studies at Yale University, Blackhawk argues that U.S. history cannot be 
                        understood without understanding how Indigenous and settler histories are interwoven. Among his points: European colonization was
                         not a foregone conclusion, Indigenous nations helped shape England's empire, Indigenous affairs were closely linked to the beginning
                         of the Revolutionary War, Indigenous peoples of California were among the first casualties of the Civil War, and Indigenous activism 
                        in the 20th century reshaped U.S. law and policy. Oxford scholar Pekka Hämäläinen's Indigenous Continent is getting lots of deserved
                         attention, but here is a voice from within.

                        “Indigenous absence has been a long tradition of American historical analysis,” writes Blackhawk, a professor of history and faculty
                        coordinator for the Yale Group for the Study of Native America. In recent years, this has changed thanks to the efforts of a new 
                       generation of historians to count marginalized groups such as women and ethnic minorities in the larger narrative. By the author’s 
                       account, American history represents an “epic encounter” between empires, Native and European, each conditioning the other. 
                       For example, pressures on the nations of the Iroquois Confederacy by British/American collision with the French Empire in North
                        America pushed Iroquoian peoples into the Ohio River Valley, creating further conflict among Indigenous groups. In his lucid 
                       exposition, Blackhawk rightly notes, “while violence was an essential institution of colonialism, it was never enough to achieve 
                       permanent goals of empire.” While violence may have secured certain short-term goals, it introduced still more instability into 
                       an already unsettled situation that endangered everyone involved. “Once it is initiated,” writes the author, “none can predict its 
                       ultimate course.” Blackhawk locates some of the most fraught moments of westward expansion in the years of the Civil War, 
                       when a preoccupied Abraham Lincoln left matters of Native policy largely to his generals in the West, advocating instead an 
                       abstract program of “assimilation, land cessions, and eventual disappearance.” Violence naturally ensued, with new Native 
                       confederations such as alliances of the Sioux and Cheyenne against the U.S. Army leading to Little Big Horn. The author 
                       closes with an analysis of the doctrine of “termination,” which attempted to dismantle Native communities, assimilate 
                       their members, and steal away their treaty lands, plans that eventually failed. Even today, though, Blackhawk notes that
                        conflict exists as interest groups attempt to erase “the hard-fought gains of the modern sovereignty movement.”
