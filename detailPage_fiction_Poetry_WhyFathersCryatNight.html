                <p>
                    Kwame Alexander delivers us a powerful and intimate memoir-in-verse. Emily 
                    Dickenson once said, “Tell all the Truth but tell it slant.” Alexander works his life 
                    into his poetry to help us reflect on our own lives. A memoir in a book of poetry 
                    - a most sublime gift.

                    This powerful memoir from a #1 New York Times bestselling author and Newbery

                    In an intimate and non-traditional (or "new-fashioned") memoir, Kwame Alexander 
                    shares snapshots of a man learning how to love. He takes us through stories of his 
                    parents: from being awkward newlyweds in the sticky Chicago summer of 1967, to 
                    the sometimes-confusing ways they showed their love to each other, and for him. He 
                    explores his own relationships—his difficulties as a newly wedded, 22-year-old 
                    father, and the precariousness of his early marriage working in a jazz club with his 
                    second wife. Alexander attempts to deal with the unravelling of his marriage and the 
                    grief of his mother's recent passing while sharing the solace he found in learning 
                    how to perfect her famous fried chicken dish. With an open heart, Alexander weaves 
                    together memories of his past to try and understand his greatest love: his daughters.

                    Full of heartfelt reminisces, family recipes, love poems, and personal letters, Why 
                    Fathers Cry at Night inspires bravery and vulnerability in every reader who has 
                    experienced the reckless passion, heartbreak, failure, and joy that define the 
                    whirlwind woes and wonders of love.

                <p>
                    In this heartfelt memoir, Newbery medalist Alexander (Rebound) churns on what he has learned—and is still learning—about love. 
                    He traces his model for romance to his parents, who taught him to “use his words,” but were rarely affectionate and lived apart 
                    for decades. He shares hard-won lessons from the painful dissolution of his own marriages and his grief not only for those 
                    relationships but also for the questions he became too afraid to ask his father after his mother's death. Finally, he turns to his 
                    daughters and confronts the difficulty of embracing solitude as they grow up and away from the family home. Interleaved 
                    through these reflections are sensuous memories of meals and music, from cracking a $250 beer with poet Nikki Giovanni 
                    to reverse engineering his mother’s fried chicken recipe after she died. Alexander observes that “we sometimes find poems in 
                    the strangest and most uncomfortable places,” and, indeed, this candid and courageous work finds poetry in places both 
                    ordinary and extraordinary. It’s a quiet triumph. Agent: Deneen Howell, Williams & Connolly. (May)Correction: An earlier 
                    version of this review incorrectly stated that both of the author's parents are deceased.

                        "Written with candor, warmth, and heart-wrenching grace, Why Fathers Cry at Night is nothing short of a marvel, animating 
                        humanity’s most important questions: What does it mean to grieve, to have the courage to surrender, to find a home in this 
                        tumultuous world, and to learn to love again? With radiance and poetic precision, Kwame Alexander’s words will remind you 
                        of art’s infinite sustenance. As soon as I turned the last page, I started again."

                        “This is not a traditional memoir,” writes Newbery Medalist Alexander in the first of three introductions. “These are just snapshots 
                        of a man learning to love. Again.” In the second introduction, “A Letter to My Daughters,” the author writes, “All the things I wished 
                        I could have learned from my mother and was too afraid to ask my father are between these covers.” In the third, “How to Read 
                        This Book,” he advises, “Let these humble meditations and musings / carry you close, permanent, abreast—a wave.” The remaining sections 
                        of the book include “Looking for Me,” “A Letter to My Mother,” and an eponymous section. Using poetry, prose, and recipes, Alexander 
                        reminiscences about healing his long-distant relationship with his father; moving forward following the death of his beloved mother; being 
                        inspired to become a writer by—and being a college student of—Nikki Giovanni (“My first grade in Nikki’s class was a C‑minus. I was 
                        disappointed, but not discouraged”); the beginning and end of marriage (“and I remember feeling defeated / at not having a key / to my 
                        own wife’s apartment”); and myriad lessons about how to live a curious and wholehearted life. “Part of moving yourself forward in a 
                        life-giving way,” he writes to one of his children, “is to take the things from the past that have helped shape and mold you and use them 
                        as anchors to the future.” Writing about certain recipes, the author describes when and why he makes them—e.g., “this 7UP pound cake 
                        represents family tradition, connection, and love. Now, for the best results, don’t go substituting Sprite”; and Granny’s hot buttered rolls 
                        (“What I’m listening to while I bake: ‘Brighter Day’ by Kirk Franklin”). Alexander connects disparate forms through his disarmingly 
                        forthright, humble voice, familiar vernacular, and optimism.

                        Kwame Alexander, poet and narrator of several of his own books, brings poignancy to his "snapshots of a man learning to love. Again." 
                        His memoir is a savory-sweet mix of poems, letters, and recipes. Regardless of form, they are shot through with a poet's rhythms, sensory 
                        memories, moving moments of learning, and unique experiences that strike a universal chord. Candidly, Alexander brings authenticity to 
                        remembering his and other family members' failures, loves, and wisdom. He does not shy away from stories about resolving a difficult 
                        relationship with his father, missing deadlines, and other expressions of sensuality, grief, divorce, or death. Strong emotional tones reflect 
                        the devotion he feels for his daughters; his mentor, Nikki Giovanni; and his beloved mother. S.W. Winner of AudioFile Earphones Award
