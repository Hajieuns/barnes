                    Yuval Noah Harari’s 21 Lessons for the 21st Century is a probing and visionary 
                    investigation into today’s most urgent issues as we move into the uncharted territory 
                    of the future. As technology advances faster than our understanding of it, hacking 
                    becomes a tactic of war, and the world feels more polarized than ever, Harari 
                    addresses the challenge of navigating life in the face of constant and disorienting 
                    change and raises the important questions we need to ask ourselves in order to 
                    survive.           
                </p>
                <p>
                    In twenty-one accessible chapters that are both provocative and profound, Harari 
                    builds on the ideas explored in his previous books, untangling political, 
                    technological, social, and existential issues and offering advice on how to prepare 
                    for a very different future from the world we now live in: How can we retain 
                    freedom of choice when Big Data is watching us? What will the future workforce 
                    look like, and how should we ready ourselves for it? How should we deal with the 
                    threat of terrorism? Why is liberal democracy in crisis?       
                </p>
                <p>
                    Harari’s unique ability to make sense of where we have come from and where we 
                    are going has captured the imaginations of millions of readers. Here he invites us to 
                    consider values, meaning, and personal engagement in a world full of noise and 
                    uncertainty. When we are deluged with irrelevant information, clarity is power. 
                    Presenting complex contemporary challenges clearly and accessibly, 21 Lessons for 
                    the 21st Century is essential reading.

                    The human mind wants to worry. This is not necessarily a bad thing—after all, if a bear is stalking you, worrying about it 
                    may well save your life. Although most of us don’t need to lose too much sleep over bears these days, modern life does 
                    present plenty of other reasons for concern: terrorism, climate change, the rise of A.I., encroachments on our privacy, even 
                    the apparent decline of international cooperation. In his fascinating new book, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, the historian 
                    Yuval Noah Harari creates a useful framework for confronting these fears. While his previous best sellers, Sapiens and Homo
                     Deus, covered the past and future respectively, his new book is all about the present. The trick for putting an end to our 
                    anxieties, he suggests, is not to stop worrying. It’s to know which things to worry about, and how much to worry about them. . . .
                     Harari is such a stimulating writer that even when I disagreed, I wanted to keep reading and thinking. . . . [Harari] has teed 
                    up a crucial global conversation about how to take on the problems of the twenty-first century.”

                    Harari’s 21 Lessons for the 21st Century would deserve serious consideration. In this collection of provocative essays, Harari,
                    author of the critically praised Sapiens and Homo Deus, tackles a daunting array of issues, endeavoring to answer a persistent 
                   question: ‘What is happening in the world today, and what is the deep meaning of these events?’ . . . Harari makes a passionate
                    argument for reshaping our educational systems and replacing our current emphasis on quickly outdated substantive knowledge

                    international bestseller about human origins and avoided the sophomore jinx writing about our destiny, Harari proves that 
                    he has not lost his touch, casting a brilliantly insightful eye on today’s myriad crises, from Trump to terrorism, Brexit to big
                     data. . . . [In] twenty-one painfully astute essays, he delivers his take on where our increasingly ‘post-truth’ world is headed.
                     Human ingenuity, which enables us to control the outside world, may soon re-engineer our insides, extend life, and guide our 
                    thoughts. Science-fiction movies get the future wrong, if only because they have happy endings. Most readers will find Harari’s
                     narrative deliciously reasonable, including his explanation of the stories (not actually true but rational) of those who elect 
                    dictators, populists, and nationalists. His remedies for wildly disruptive technology (biotech, infotech) and its consequences
                     (climate change, mass unemployment) ring true, provided nations act with more good sense than they have shown throughout 
                    history. Harari delivers yet another tour de force.”—Kirkus Reviews (starred review)

                        In his fascinating new book, 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, the historian Yuval Noah Harari…mostly resists handy prescriptions. He's 
                        more interested in defining the terms of the discussion and giving you historical and philosophical perspective…Harari is such a stimulating 
                        writer that even when I disagreed, I wanted to keep reading and thinking…he has teed up a crucial global conversation about how to take 
                        on the problems of the 21st century.

                        Magnificently combining historical, scientific, political, and philosophical perspectives, Harari (Sapiens and Homo Deus), a Hebrew University
                        of Jerusalem history professor, explores 21 of what he considers to be today’s “greatest challenges.” Despite the title’s reference to “lessons,” 
                       his tone is not prescriptive but exploratory, seeking to provoke debate without offering definitive solutions. An early chapter is headlined with
                        the lesson, “When You Grow Up, You Might Not Have a Job.” Not only will many jobs be lost to machines, but, Harari speculates, humans
                        might not even be necessary to fulfill the role of consumers: “Theoretically, you can have an economy in which a mining corporation produces 
                       and sells iron to a robotics corporation, and the robotics corporation produces and sells robots to the mining corporation.” A chapter beginning
                        with the lesson “Those Who Own the Data Own the Future” discusses how the improved human understanding of mind and brain, and the 
                       ability to manipulate both, raises the threat of control by those with access to one’s data, making the regulation of data ownership perhaps “the
                        most important political question of our era.” Within this broad construct, Harari discusses many pressing issues, including problems associated
                        with liberal democracy, nationalism, immigration, and religion. This well-informed and searching book is one to be savored and widely
                        discussed. (Sept.)

                        Narrator Derek Perkins’s tone reflects a thoughtful balance of authoritative knowledge and openness, making this audiobook less a lecture of
                        ideas and more a shared conversation. Harari, the Israeli historian who is the author of SAPIENS, offers essays on the intellectual and practical
                        needs of the 21st century, focusing on the grand-scale issues facing humanity. His concerns are significant, including automation of the 
                       workforce, the creeping public dissolution of fact in favor of subjective perception, the rise of “fake news,” and the eventual effects of global 
                       warming in the face of political apathy. Listeners are encouraged to consider multiple points of view, and Perkins delivers them earnestly, 
                       creating a contemplative mood. S.P.C. © AudioFile 2018, Portland, Maine

                        A highly instructive exploration of "current affairs and…the immediate future of human societies."Having produced an international bestseller
                        about human origins (Sapiens, 2015, etc.) and avoided the sophomore jinx writing about our destiny (Homo Deus, 2017), Harari 
                       (History/Hebrew Univ. of Jerusalem) proves that he has not lost his touch, casting a brilliantly insightful eye on today's myriad crises, from 
                       Trump to terrorism, Brexit to big data. As the author emphasizes, "humans think in stories rather than in facts, numbers, or equations, and 
                       the simpler the story, the better. Every person, group, and nation has its own tales and myths." Three grand stories once predicted the future.
                        World War II eliminated the fascist story but stimulated communism for a few decades until its collapse. The liberal story—think democracy,
                        free markets, and globalism—reigned supreme for a decade until the 20th-century nasties—dictators, populists, and nationalists—came back
                        in style. They promote jingoism over international cooperation, vilify the opposition, demonize immigrants and rival nations, and then win 
                       elections. "A bit like the Soviet elites in the 1980s," writes Harari, "liberals don't understand how history deviates from its preordained 
                       course, and they lack an alternative prism through which to interpret reality." The author certainly understands, and in 21 painfully astute 
                       essays, he delivers his take on where our increasingly "post-truth" world is headed. Human ingenuity, which enables us to control the
                        outside world, may soon re-engineer our insides, extend life, and guide our thoughts. Science-fiction movies get the future wrong, if only
                        because they have happy endings. Most readers will find Harari's narrative deliciously reasonable, including his explanation of the stories
                        (not actually true but rational) of those who elect dictators, populists, and nationalists. His remedies for wildly disruptive technology

                       they have shown throughout history.Harari delivers yet another tour de force.
