                <h3>Notes From Your Bookseller</h3>
                <p>
                    The Hurting Kind by Ada Limón is our favorite type of poetry book. Each word, 
                    sentence and phrase takes us by the hand and walks us through a beautiful and 
                    visual landscape. We stick with each poem for multiple readings, not out of 
                    confusion but of refusal to let it go. Yes, it’s that good ... page after page.                    
                </p>
                <p class="bold">
                    An astonishing collection about interconnectedness—between the human and 
                    nonhuman, ancestors and ourselves—from National Book Critics Circle Award 
                    winner, National Book Award finalist and U.S. Poet Laureate Ada Limón.               
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I have always been too sensitive, a weeper / from a long line of weepers,” writes 
                    Limón. “I am the hurting kind.” What does it mean to be the hurting kind? To be 
                    sensitive not only to the world’s pain and joys, but to the meanings that bend in the 
                    scrim between the natural world and the human world? To divine the relationships 
                    between us all? To perceive ourselves in other beings—and to know that those 
                    beings are resolutely their own, that they “do not / care to be seen as symbols”?                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    With Limón’s remarkable ability to trace thought, The Hurting Kind explores those 
                    questions—incorporating others’ stories and ways of knowing, making surprising 
                    turns, and always reaching a place of startling insight. These poems slip through the 
                    seasons, teeming with horses and kingfishers and the gleaming eyes of fish. And they 
                    honor parents, stepparents, and grandparents: the sacrifices made, the separate lives 
                    lived, the tendernesses extended to a hurting child; the abundance, in retrospect, of 
                    having two families.                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Along the way, we glimpse loss. There are flashes of the pandemic, ghosts whose 
                    presence manifests in unexpected memories and the mysterious behavior of pets left 
                    behind. But The Hurting Kind is filled, above all, with connection and the delight of 
                    being in the world. “Slippery and waddle thieving my tomatoes still / green in the 
                    morning’s shade,” writes Limón of a groundhog in her garden, “she is doing what 
                    she can to survive.”

                    The tender, arresting sixth collection from Limón (The Carrying) is an ode to the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth that characterizes the 
                    natural world. The work is divided into four sections (after the four seasons), and is frequently set in the poet’s garden. In this Edenic 
                    location, Limón observes the flora and fauna, which can lead to personal revelations. In “Foaling Season,” the speaker describes a pasture 
                    full of mares and their foals, which allows her to reflect on her decision not to have children. Limón’s descriptions of animals are richly 
                    evocative; a groundhog is “a liquidity moving, all muscle and bristle... slippery and waddle-thieving my tomatoes.” The title poem movingly 
                    pays homage to the poet’s family and ancestors as she recalls how her grandparents told her “never/ to kill a California King, benevolent/ as 
                    they were, equanimous like earth or sky, not// toothy like the dog Chaco who barked/ at nearly every train whistle or roadrunner.” In the 
                    “Summer” section, Limón contemplates cockroaches and spiderwort, then briefly recalls a trip to Argentina before declaring, “And now the 
                    world is gone. No more Buenos Aires or Santiago.” Limón’s crystalline language is a feast for the senses, bringing monumental significance 
                    to the minuscule and revealing life in every blade of grass. (May)

                        "So grateful am I for Limón's powerfully observant eye. There are many wonderful poems here and a handful of genuine masterpieces . . . 
                        The Hurting Kind is packed with quiet celebrations of the quotidian . . . Limón forces herself to confront, again and again in these poems, 
                        nature's unwillingness to yield its secrets—it's one of her primary subjects. The seemingly abundant wisdom of the nature world is really a 
                        vision of her own searching reflection . . . Limón is great company in the presence of the inchoate, able and willing to stand with her readers

                        "Limón’s poems are unique for the deep attention they pay to both the world’s wounds and its redemptive beauty. In otherwise dark times, they 
                        have the power to open us up to the wonder and awe that the world still inspires."—The Ezra Klein Show

                        "[Ada Limón] is one of my all-time favorite writers, someone whose work I return to again and again for solace, inspiration, and truth."
                        —Nicole Chung, The Atlantic

                    <span>
                        "For poet Ada Limón, evidence of poetry is everywhere. It connects big ideas—like fear, isolation, even death—with little details—like field 
                        sparrows, a box of matches, or 'the body moving / freely.' The award-winning poet's sixth and latest collection, The Hurting Kind, is a 
                        testament to the power of such sensitivity . . . The power of attention, Limón conveys, is in finding out just how an individual's experience might fit 
                        into the collective experience. But in The Hurting Kind Limón takes her method even further to ask: Isn't wonder enough? . . .  Above all, The 
                        Hurting Kind asks for our attention to stay tender. To know that the world is here to both guide us and lead us astray. Toward the end of the long 
                        poem, Limón writes: 'I will not stop this reporting of attachments. / There is evidence everywhere.' So don't stop looking. Just be open to what you 
                        may find. And know that the world is watching you, too."—NPR

                    <span>
                        "Ada Limón is a bright light in a dark time. Her keen attention to the natural world is only matched by her incredible emotional honesty.... 
                        Considering the arc from youthful vibrancy to protective camouflage, Limón tracks the beauty of wisdom as we age. Reconciling the all too human 
                        matter of our lives within the spectacle of nature, Limón archives a suspended grace.... The Hurting Kind ... explor[es] the restorative connections 
                        between human life and the natural world. The poems reckon with vulnerability and grief in a startling and broken world."—Vanity Fair

                    <span>
                        "In one of Ada Limón's early poems, she asks, 'Shouldn't we make fire out of everyday things?' For the past 16 years, that's exactly what she's done. 
                        [She is] fearlessly confessional and technically brilliant."—Washington Post

                    <span>
                        “Again and again in this poetry collection, her sixth, Limón confronts nature’s unwillingness to yield its secrets—it’s one of her primary subjects. 
                        The seemingly abundant wisdom of the natural world is really a vision of her own searching reflection. 'Limón looks out her window, walks around 
                        her yard, and, like Emily Dickinson, trips over infinities,' our reviewer wrote.”—New York Times, "100 Notable Books of 2022"                        
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        "Ada Limón’s sixth and latest collection is a testament to the power of sensitivity. As with her previous award-winning books, The Carrying and 
                        Bright Dead Things, these poems are acutely aware of the natural world. And Limón has a knack for acknowledging nature’s little mysteries in 
                        order to fully capture its history and abundance. For her, evidence of poetry is everywhere. She connects big ideas—fear, isolation, even death—
                        with little details, like field sparrows, a box of matches or ‘the body moving / freely.’ Above all, The Hurting Kind asks for our attention to stay 
                        tender."—Jeevika Verma, NPR, Books We Love                        
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        “In Limón’s newest collection, she writes poems suffused with nostalgia, longing, and grief, divided up by the seasons, writing of nurturing seeds, 
                        steadfast love, grief, burial. She writes of joyful wonder and powerful grief. Of getting high and staring up at cherry trees, of earning a cat’s trust, 
                        of seeing the neighbors get a tree cut down, all tangled up in stories of emotionally manipulative relationships and family discoveries and what real 
                        love looks like. Mainly, she writes about what it’s like to be ‘the hurting kind’ of person—a tender kind of person, sensitive to the pain she sees and 
                        the small joys she glimpses out in the world, soft, vulnerable, painfully empathetic. It’s the kind of person I am, and I saw myself so deeply in these 
                        poems. Limón’s hit it out of the park once again.”—BookRiot, Best Books of the Year
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        "These poems home in on how grief makes us human . . . [Limón] reminds readers that we are nothing without connection. If you haven't read 
                        poetry in a while, this volume might be what you need to reconnect with the form."—Los Angeles Times
                    </span>
                    <span>"Brilliant . . . Throughout is the trademark wonder, and blown-out perceptivity, underscoring Limón's clarion melancholy."—San Francisco Chronicle0</span>
                    <span>
                        “The Hurting Kind is a book of living language — and nowhere more than in the way words animate the poems . . .  Throughout [Limón’s] work, the 
                        language is direct and unadorned while also playful and full of unexpected turns. Something similar is true of The Hurting Kind, which is a quieter 
                        book — but no less fierce for being so. . . . When Limón exclaims, in the last line of the poem and the collection, ‘I am asking you to touch me,’ she is 
                        writing out of the darkness of the pandemic, but she is also addressing something more universal and profound. What are words worth if they can’t 
                        help to bridge the gaps between us? It’s a question many of us are asking as we try to navigate this fallen world."—David Ulin, Los Angeles Times
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        “The Hurting Kind, Ada Limón’s sixth poetry collection, embodies the interconnectedness of survival and surrender . . . Limón’s opus, a poetic sonic 
                        composition of observation, shifts between the tense positions of witness and watcher. Rather than end tidily with a conclusion, she leans into actionable 
                        hope. How could Limón have anticipated that current history would speak in harmony with The Hurting Kind? Today, more so than when I first read it, 
                        a line in the title poem hits me harder and with greater poignancy — ‘Now teach me poetry.’”—Yvonne Conza, Los Angeles Review of Books
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        "Limón responds in her poetry to what she identifies as an ecological imperative to re-describe our relationship to 'nature' in a manner that isn't merely 
                        instrumental. The moving personal dramas that her poems detail can never be separated from the landscape in which they occur . . . Consequently, her 
                        poetry, which can feel so intimate and self-revealing, is almost constantly political at the same time . . . There are endless things to say about the articulate, 
                        complex emotional resonance of the poems in this book. Still, what Limón says about 'a life' is true as well for her book: 'You can't sum it up.'"
                        —Forrest Gander, Brooklyn Rail 
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        "Stunning . . . [A] kind of internal whiplash, in which quiet everyday moments become the unwitting prisms through which we suddenly start to see our 
                        true selves, is a hallmark of Limón's work. Over the course of six collections of poems, she has proven herself adept at balancing whip-smart emotional 
                        observation with graceful descriptions of the natural world . . . After her last collection, 2018's The Carrying, won the National Book Critics Circle 
                        Award, she established herself as the rarest form of American poet—the kind that resonates with an audience that does not normally pay attention to 
                        contemporary poetry. Her elegant narrative poems are keenly observed, remarkably accessible, and pack an emotional wallop."—Departures    
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        “[A] shimmering new collection of poems . . . The matter of aliveness is at the very core of The Hurting Kind, a collection that feels as though it’s right 
                        on time, with verse that hews close-to-the-bone and is uncommonly relatable in its unflinching, but deeply compassionate, treatment of human pain. 
                        Rather than working to dodge the hurt, to make meaning of it so that it might be transmuted from wound into scar, The Hurting Kind is an invitation 
                        to sink into the ache, pressing willingly on the bruises wrought by ‘being a body in time, being a body alive’ . . . The Hurting Kind is a work of deep 
                        humanity, of recognizing all that’s asked of us . . . It is mercy.”—Literary Hub
