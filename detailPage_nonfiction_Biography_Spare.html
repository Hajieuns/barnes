                <p>
                    Little boy, beloved son, brother, husband and father, prince, soldier, and advocate 
                    for social causes, Prince Harry Duke of Sussex has lived a life staged in the public 
                    eye, and who he really is has been the subject of second guesses, speculation, and 
                    projection. But no more. Spare is the up-close, behind the scenes, intimate, and 
                    forthright memoir of a man reclaiming his own story – its joys, sorrows, aspirations, 
                    conflicts, writ small and large. Pick it up for an unsparing glimpse into an 
                    extraordinary life!...

                    It was one of the most searing images of the twentieth century: two young boys, two 
                    princes, walking behind their mother’s coffin as the world watched in sorrow—and 
                    horror. As Princess Diana was laid to rest, billions wondered what Prince William 
                    and Prince Harry must be thinking and feeling—and how their lives would play out 
                    from that point on.         
                </p>
                <p>
                    For Harry, this is that story at last.      
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before losing his mother, twelve-year-old Prince Harry was known as the carefree 
                    one, the happy-go-lucky Spare to the more serious Heir. Grief changed everything. 
                    He struggled at school, struggled with anger, with loneliness—and, because he 
                    blamed the press for his mother’s death, he struggled to accept life in the spotlight.       
                </p>
                <p>
                    At twenty-one, he joined the British Army. The discipline gave him structure, and 
                    two combat tours made him a hero at home. But he soon felt more lost than ever, 
                    suffering from post-traumatic stress and prone to crippling panic attacks. Above all, 
                    he couldn’t find true love.            
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then he met Meghan. The world was swept away by the couple’s cinematic romance 
                    and rejoiced in their fairy-tale wedding. But from the beginning, Harry and Meghan 
                    were preyed upon by the press, subjected to waves of abuse, racism, and lies. 
                    Watching his wife suffer, their safety and mental health at risk, Harry saw no other 
                    way to prevent the tragedy of history repeating itself but to flee his mother country. 
                    Over the centuries, leaving the Royal Family was an act few had dared. The last to 
                    try, in fact, had been his mother. . . .        
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the first time, Prince Harry tells his own story, chronicling his journey with raw, 
                    unflinching honesty. A landmark publication, Spare is full of insight, revelation, 
                    self-examination, and hard-won wisdom about the eternal power of love over grief.

                    Sibling rivalry, fatherly neglect, and the crushing weight of public opinion haunt this anguished, searching, and occasionally vindictive 
                    memoir from Prince Harry. Framing the narrative as an attempt to explain why he and his wife, Meghan Markle, fled the U.K. “in fear 
                    for our sanity and physical safety” in 2020, Harry begins with Princess Diana’s death in 1997, recounting how he and his brother 
                    William were made to walk behind their mother’s coffin “to garner sympathy.” For years afterward, Harry harbored a belief that Diana 
                    had disappeared to escape the paparazzi—an illusion that enabled him “to postpone the bulk of my grief.” Made to feel like a “nullity” 
                    by his family, he found solace and companionship on safari trips to Africa and boozy nights with friends, but the tabloids turned “basic 
                    teenage stuff” into allegations of drug addiction and his father chose “to play ball” rather than fight back. Time and time again, the twin 
                    pressures of the royal family and the British media scuttled Harry’s search for meaning and purpose, leaving him beset by panic attacks and 
                    self-doubt, until he met Meghan—and then those same specters turned on her. The mix of dirty laundry and earnest soul-baring sometimes 
                    jars, but Harry’s frustrations are deeply felt and authentically conveyed, as is the joy he takes in nature and in his friendships. This royal 
                    family tell-all delivers. (Jan.)

                        Prince Harry, the youngest son of King Charles and the late iconic Diana, Princess of Wales, talks about the highlights and lowest moments of 
                        his life, from the time of his mother's tragic death and his military service to his meeting and marrying Meghan Markle. He says he was attracted 
                        to her view that life is a grand adventure, and he wanted to go on that journey with her. He also talks about their two children and shares that he 
                        and Meghan feared for their safety and their own sanity. That's one reason they left England and the working royal life, settling in Montecito, CA, 
                        at a home actor/writer/director Tyler Perry owned and offered. Another reason they fled is due to racist and misogynistic attacks against Meghan 
                        from the media and from his brother and sister-in-law, he says. The book details the rift, including alleged physical and emotional assaults, that led 
                        to the estranged relationships he now has with his father, his stepmother, his brother, and sister-in-law. The book also covers the Queen's death and 
                        funeral service. VERDICT Highly recommended for those who are curious about what happens behind the scenes of a royal family. This is a vivid 
                        and intriguing account.—Lucy Heckman

                        A royal tell-all with some substance.
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        Arriving at the end of the royal couple’s multimedia barrage that included a six-part Netflix documentary, Prince Harry’s eagerly anticipated memoir 
                        delivers further revelations about his struggles within the institution of the British monarchy and the unrelenting harassment he has endured from the 
                        British tabloids. The author also offers insights into his reported feuds with his brother, Prince William, and father, King Charles—most recently 
                        regarding his relationship with his wife, Meghan Markle. It may seem that Prince Harry has a particular ax to grind, and this notion intensifies as he 
                        recounts the events related to his courtship of Meghan. However, his story is more substantive than some readers might expect, depending on their 
                        loyalties to the monarchy. Beginning with memories of his mother’s tragic death in 1997, the author moves on to his lackluster schooling at Eton and 
                        his more remarkable career in the British Army (he served two combat tours in Afghanistan). The narrative frequently casts evocative light on the 
                        inner workings of the British monarchy and the various players involved. While his pen may be more harshly directed toward his father and brother 
                        than to others, such as Queen Elizabeth, the author also provides interesting glimpses into the likes of Prince Philip and Camilla, queen consort. 
                        If sometimes disparaging, his portraits are also surprisingly sympathetic. The prose is competent, and the author’s tales are consistently engaging—
                        and far less smarmy than the self-aggrandizing tone set in the Netflix series. Readers may question Prince Harry’s motives, but his emotional 
                        struggles, though occasionally rendered in an overwrought fashion, feel palpable and heartfelt. “My problem has never been with the monarchy, 
                        nor the concept of monarchy,” he writes. “It’s been with the press and the sick relationship that’s evolved between it and the Palace. I love my 
                        Mother Country, and I love my family, and I always will.”

                        Stifled by protocol his entire life, Prince Harry has a lot to say as he addresses rumors and lies in his memoir. His narrative style reflects a strong 
                        reserve of emotions, and his performance remains at an emotional distance for most of the sixteen-hour audiobook. His voice is clear and his tone 
                        steady, for the most part. Occasionally, such as when he discusses his military service in Afghanistan, his fear and anger come through, and when 
                        he recounts his confrontation with his brother, William, his pace quickens. Even while expressing his deep love for Meghan and his young family, 
                        he’s still reserved. Harry’s fascinating journey doesn’t disappoint, and this audiobook provides glimpses of the many emotions that lie beneath his 
                        seemingly relaxed, reserved exterior. A.L.C. © AudioFile 2023, Portland, Maine
