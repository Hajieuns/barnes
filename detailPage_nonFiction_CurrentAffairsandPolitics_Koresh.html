                    Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas. Today, we remember this moment for the 76 
                    people, including 20 children, who died in the fire; for its inspiration of the 
                    Oklahoma City bombing; and for the wave of anti-government militarism that

                <p>
                    Drawing on first-time, exclusive interviews with Koresh’s family and survivors of 
                    the siege, bestselling author Stephan Talty paints a psychological portrait of this 
                    infamous icon of the 1990s. Born Vernon Howell into the hyper-masculine world of 
                    central Texas in the 1960s, Koresh experienced a childhood riven with abuse and 
                    isolation. He found a new version of himself in the halls of his local church, and love 
                    in the fundamentalist sect of the Branch Davidians. Later, with a new name and 
                    professed prophetic powers, Koresh ushered in a new era for the Davidians that 
                    prized his own sexual conquest as much as his followers’ faith. As one survivor has 
                    said, “What better way for a worthless child to feel worth than to become God?”       
                </p>
                <p>
                    In his signature immersive storytelling, Talty reveals how Koresh’s fixation on holy 
                    war, which would deliver the Davidians to their reward and confirm himself as 
                    Christ, collided with his paranoid obsession with firearms to destructive effect. Their 
                    deadly, 51-day standoff with the embattled FBI and ATF, he shows, embodied an 
                    anti-government ethic that continues to resonate today.            
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, thirty years after that unforgettable moment, Koresh presents the tragedy at 
                    Waco—and the government mistrust it inspired—in its fullest context yet.

                <span>
                    In this searing account, journalist Talty (The Black Hand) paints a detailed portrait of David Koresh, the leader of the Branch Davidian cult. 
                    From his unwed teen mother’s religious obsession to his stepfather’s physical and mental abuse, Koresh, born Vernon Wayne Howell in 1959,
                     struggled through life, exhibiting both mental and learning disabilities. Searching for love and purpose through religion and sex, he stumbled 
                    into the Branch Davidian sect in Waco, Tex., and worked his way from being something of a rather pathetic lost sheep to an egotistical prophet
                     spouting delusions about angels and God. As his power grew, so did his derangement until he demanded more and more from his followers;
                     he sexually abused underage girls and denied adults food and the right to marry. By 1990, some had broken free and left the cult, while 
                    Koresh armed the true believers that remained at his Mount Carmel compound. Talty makes a solid case that Koresh alternated between 
                    delusions of grandeur and possibly knowing he was insane, and that the tragic outcome of the government standoff with the Davidians in 
                    1993 was aided by the media circus surrounding it and the conflict between the ATF and the FBI. This well-researched and enlightening
                     book is un-put-downable. Agent: Susan Canavan, Waxman Agency. (Apr.)

                        "Koresh reads like a fever dream, with the quality of a timeless tragedy. It’s also a bracing antidote to toxic conspiracy theories that have 
                        surrounded the calamitous siege in Waco for decades. Loaded with astonishing, often shocking detail, we see how tragedy had been brewing 
                        for years beforehand. David Koresh emerges not as a hapless religious eccentric unfairly targeted by the law, but as a fully actualized cult 
                        leader — as manipulative and canny as Charles Manson, and as grandiose and apocalyptic as Jim Jones. Talty’s blistering account doesn’t let
                         the government off the hook — but if you think you know what really happened at Waco and why, think again."

                        "David Koresh is like no other cult leader or apocalyptic prophet, and Stephan Talty takes readers deep inside his head. A brilliant portrait
                        of an American madman, Koresh is told in chilling detail, with great pacing and vivid scene setting. Someday, when this book gets made 
                       into a blockbuster movie, you will say that the book was better." — A.J. Baime, New York Times

                        "Stephan Talty’s Koresh is at once a deeply reported biography of the self-anointed final prophet and a riveting reconstruction of
                        the deadly and disastrous siege of the Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas. With new information and fresh insights, his penetrating 
                       rendering of David Koresh’s bizarre life and death is clear-eyed and compelling." — Dick Lehr, author of Black Mass:

                        "Stephen Talty is a dogged reporter and a gifted writer, and in his hands, Koresh burns with timely relevance and urgency. 
                        Reminiscent of Norman Mailer’s, The Executioner’s Song, Talty brings the life and violent death of David Koresh into a purely
                         American context, with a story that will keep readers on the edge of their seats until the very end."

                        "Childhood abuse, untreated paranoia, and a passion for salvation through violence kindled the historic conflagration at Waco that 
                        killed a messianic preacher and 75 of his followers. Stephan Talty sifts the ashes of that inferno to deliver a deeply researched, 
                        fast-paced and insightful book—one that exposes not only the tragedy’s causes but embers that still burn today." — Mara Leveritt,

                        The rise of extremist patriot groups and militias, including those who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, has inspired several new
                        books about the Branch Davidians, a sect that many right-wing groups believe was exterminated at the hands of the tyrannical U.S.
                        government. Drawing on sources that include FBI files and eyewitness testimony, Talty focuses his thoroughly researched history on 
                       the troubled and troubling life of Vernon Wayne Howell (1959-1993), better known as the Branch Davidians’ leader David Koresh. 
                       Howell grew up among Seventh-day Adventists in a small town in East Texas, raised in part by his grandmother while his 14-year-old
                        mother worked at one menial job after another. His childhood was marked by cruelty: He was bullied by other kids, whipped by his
                        frustrated mother and her new husband, and sexually molested. He hated school but loved church; most of all, he loved the Bible. 
                       He claimed to have visions and to hear God. “As one local writer said, saying God talked to you was like saying the Avon lady rang 
                       you doorbell that morning,” writes Talty. “It happened to someone every day.” The author follows his subject’s search for acceptance, 
                       by the Adventists, Southern Baptists, and by girls he fell madly in love with. One after another, they rejected him, fed up with his religious 
                       proclamations, egotism, and need to control every aspect of their lives. As one girlfriend put it, “His visions were curiously tailored to what 
                       he wanted.” In 1981, Howell’s fortunes changed after he insinuated himself into a leadership role among the Branch Davidians; in 1990, he
                        changed his name to reflect his status as their savior. Talty recounts in vivid detail his rise among unquestioning followers; his apocalyptic 
                       prophecy that led them to amass weapons; and the ill-conceived government surveillance that ended in a deadly raid.
