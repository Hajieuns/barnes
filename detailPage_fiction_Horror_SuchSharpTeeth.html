                <h3>Notes From Your Bookseller</h3>
                <p>
                    A darkly humorous, and at times, romantic twist on the classic werewolf tale. 
                    Blending body horror with a monstrous narrative around identity, rage and 
                    transformation, it’s both cozy and terrifying. A compulsive read with bite!         
                </p>
                <p>
                    A young woman in need of a transformation finds herself in touch with the animal 
                    inside in this gripping, incisive USA Today bestselling novel from the author of 
                    Cackle and The Return.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rory Morris isn’t thrilled to be moving back to her hometown, even if it is 
                    temporary. There are bad memories there. But her twin sister, Scarlett, is pregnant, 
                    estranged from the baby’s father, and needs support, so Rory returns to the place 
                    she thought she’d put in her rearview. After a night out at a bar where she runs into 
                    Ian, an old almost-flame, she hits a large animal with her car. And when she gets out 
                    to investigate, she’s attacked.    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rory survives, miraculously, but life begins to look and feel different. She’s 
                    unnaturally strong, with an aversion to silver—and suddenly the moon has her in 
                    its thrall. She’s changing into someone else—something else, maybe even a monster. 
                    But does that mean she’s putting those close to her in danger? Or is embracing the 
                    wildness inside of her the key to acceptance?      
                </p>
                <p>
                    This darkly comedic love story is a brilliantly layered portrait of trauma, rage, and 
                    vulnerability.

                <span>
                    "Wonderfully witty and wild. It's also heady and daring in how the story explores friend and family dynamics, the anger women 
                    aren't allowed to express within our culture, and the wounds that transform us against our will. The next full moon I see, I'll be 
                    rooting for Rory."–Paul Tremblay, author of The Cabin at the End of the World and The Pallbearers Club 
                </span>
                <span>
                    "No one is writing horror that explores the intricacies of femininity like Rachel Harrison. This brilliant story is about accepting your 
                    identity, your past, love, friendship, and family... all wrapped up in a deeply satisfying and scary monster tale. Such Sharp Teeth is as 
                    irresistible as the pull of the full moon—I couldn't tear myself away." – Mallory O'Meara, bestselling author of The Lady From the Black Lagoon
                </span>
                <span>
                    “Rachel Harrison has written a witty and wholly original exploration of lycanthropy, trauma, and the monsters that reside within all 
                    of us, if we dig deep enough to find them. Such Sharp Teeth is an incredibly compelling read that’s full of horror and heart. It's the 
                    werewolf book I've been waiting for and I can’t recommend it enough.” –Alexis Henderson, Author of The Year of the Witching and 
                    House of Hunger         
                </span>

                    "Darkly comic and modern...a story about rage, trauma and leaning into one's wild side."-USA Today 
                </span>
                <span>
                    "At turns heart-warming, heart-rending, and a little monstrous, Harrison's latest gives anything but your typical big bad wolf story. Such 
                    Sharp Teeth runs slick with bone-crackling wit and cunning, but don't be fooled by that grin; this wolf has a bite." - Hailey Piper, Bram 
                    Stoker Award-winning author of Queen of Teeth         
                </span>
                <span>
                    “Rachel Harrison’s razor sharp prose cuts straight to the bone. With its quick-witted dialogue and acutely human regard for its cursed 
                    characters, Such Sharp Teeth solidifies her spot as the alpha author of heartfelt horror.”–Clay McLeod Chapman, author of Ghost Eaters      
                </span>
                <span>
                    "With prose as sleek as a wolf in full stride, Such Sharp Teeth feels at once like a classic werewolf story, and something delightfully new. 
                    It's a breathless, poignant, blood-and-flesh-licking tale that asks: when our distractions and coping mechanisms are shredded away, who–
                    or what–are we? And it confirms once again that Rachel Harrison is horror's poet laureate of quarter-life dread and existential transition."

                        Harrison (The Return) tries and fails to carry a metaphor about “the secrets our bodies keep” into a story that simultaneously wants to be body 
                        horror, a reckoning with the trauma of childhood sexual abuse, and a cute teen-crush-revisited romance. Rory Morris returns to her podunk 
                        hometown to help out her pregnant twin. The move, which she insists is temporary, puts her back in contact with her mother, who refuses to 
                        take responsibility for the abuse Rory experienced as a child at the hands of her mother’s boyfriend, and with Ian Pedretti, Rory’s high school 
                        crush whom her sister still thinks she should date. But Rory has more immediate problems when a bite from a mysterious creature turns her into 
                        a werewolf, complete with superstrength and violent, skin-sloughing transformations at the full moon. There are moments of cathartic rage as 
                        Rory puts an aggressively drunk partygoer in his place and visits a smash room with Ian, but she never really gets to work through her issues. 
                        The comedic tone of Rory’s social interactions rubs weirdly against the trauma plot, and the ultimate management of Rory’s werewolf-ism feels 
                        too pat, with Harrison failing to drive home an analogy between the transformation and Rory’s inner turmoil. It’s an emotionally confusing and 
                        unsatisfying mess. Agent: Lucy Carson, Friedrich Agency. (Oct.)

                        Harrison's (Cackle) latest is a rip-roaring, bloody adventure that also explores the wounds trauma can leave on both the body and the psyche. 
                        Aurora has come home to help her pregnant sister when the unthinkable happens—Aurora is transformed into a werewolf. But that is just where 
                        the story begins. Through explorations of femininity, childhood, family, growth, and facing fears, Harrison crafts a compelling story that is 
                        extremely difficult to put down. Beyond the basic horror tenets that a werewolf story embodies, the novel also grasps the deeper consequences of 
                        transformation and trauma. The author's style is gripping and will keep you reading way past your bedtime, although it instills enough gory 
                        goodness to make sure that your eventual sleep is troubled. VERDICT Any library looking to acquire a gut punch of a horror novel that will 
                        appeal to a broad audience would do well to add this to their collection. It will also appeal to fans of Mongrels by Stephen Graham Jones and Her 
                        Body and Other Parties by Carmen Maria Machado.—Jeremiah Paddock

                        Kristen Sieh narrates this story of sisterhood with a twist. Rory is taking temporary leave from her job in New York City because her twin sister needs 
                        her help. On her way home, she hits an animal, stops to investigate, and, as luck would have it, is attacked by what turns out to be a werewolf. Being 
                        back to her hometown isn’t appealing until she meets up with Ian, an old crush from high school. Sieh captures Rory’s persona as a supportive sister, 
                        as well as the feelings of crankiness that accompany her support, especially when a full moon approaches. Sieh keeps the mood light as Rory struggles 
                        to come to terms with her new reality. J.E.M. © AudioFile 2022, Portland, Maine
