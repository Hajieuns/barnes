                    Worth a read before or after you watch the HBO series. This is a haunting story 
                    that only gets darker and more devilish the deeper you go. Just when you think 
                    you’ve got it all figured out, the twists keep coming.

                    master storyteller Stephen King.

                <p>
                    An eleven-year-old boy’s violated corpse is discovered in a town park. Eyewitnesses 
                    and fingerprints point unmistakably to one of Flint City’s most popular citizens—
                    Terry Maitland, Little League coach, English teacher, husband, and father of two 
                    girls. Detective Ralph Anderson, whose son Maitland once coached, orders a quick 
                    and very public arrest. Maitland has an alibi, but Anderson and the district attorney 
                    soon have DNA evidence to go with the fingerprints and witnesses. Their case seems 
                    ironclad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the investigation expands and horrifying details begin to emerge, King’s story 
                    kicks into high gear, generating strong tension and almost unbearable suspense. 
                    Terry Maitland seems like a nice guy, but is he wearing another face? When the 
                    answer comes, it will shock you as only Stephen King can.

                    I don't want to spoil anything, but come on, this is Stephen King. Monsters of one kind or another are what the man does best,
                    and The Outsider delivers a good one…King is an industry and has been for my entire reading life. He could easily churn out 
                   "monsters in Maine" tales until his life ends, and he'd remain well compensated for it. But he doesn't do that. He isn't writing 
                   mere imitations of himself. More than 50 novels published, and he's still adding new influences to his work…This expansiveness 
                   allows King to highlight the idea that whether we're talking about Mexico or Maine, Oklahoma or Texas, people the world over tell 
                   certain stories for reasons that feel much the same: to understand the mysteries of our universe, the improbable and inexplicable…
                   Here's to mutant rats in the basement and Mexican myths; here's to the strange and to Stephen King. Still inspiring.

                        MWA Grand Master King wraps a wild weird tale inside a police procedural in this nicely executed extension of his Bill Hodges 
                        detective trilogy (begun with 2014’s Mr. Mercedes). Det. Ralph Anderson of the Flint City, Okla., police force appears to have 
                        beloved youth baseball league coach Terry Maitland dead to rights when he publicly arrests him for the grisly murder of an 
                        11-year-old boy, since the crime scene is covered with Terry’s fingerprints and DNA. Only one problem: at the time of the 
                        murder Terry was attending a teachers’ conference in a distant city, where he was caught clearly on videotape. The case’s 
                        contradictory evidence compels Anderson and officials associated with it to team up with Holly Gibney (the deceased Hodges’s 
                        former assistant) to solve it. What begins as a manhunt for an unlikely doppelgänger takes an uncanny turn into the supernatural. 
                        King’s skillful use of criminal forensics helps to ground his tale in a believable clinical reality where the horrors stand out in sharp 
                        relief. Agent: Chuck Verrill, Darhansoff & Verrill. (May)

                        “What begins as a manhunt for an unlikely doppelgänger takes an uncanny turn into the supernatural. King’s skillful use of 
                        criminal forensics helps to ground his tale in a believable clinical reality where the horrors stand out in sharp relief.”

                        strongest books in the past decade; an enjoyable dovetailing of crime and supernatural horror that will please Constant Readers

                        is scarier than finding out the truth...The Outsider gives King fans exactly what they want at the same time as cramming in new ideas,

                        The Outsider is proof King isn’t losing his touch: It’s a first-rate example of his signature technique of combining solidly realistic writing and 
                        believable characters with disturbingly creepy horror...a horrifying ride that challenges its characters not to succumb to their own darkness.”

                        When a young boy's mutilated corpse is found in a public park, the evidence points to Little League coach and high school English teacher 
                        Terry Maitland. Despite his vehement claims of innocence, witnesses put him at the scene of the crime, and his fingerprints and DNA are found 
                        all over the murder scene. The police have an airtight case, except that other witnesses and video also confirm Terry's alibi: that he was miles away 
                        at a teacher's convention on the night of the murder. For Det. Ralph Anderson, it is simultaneously the most straightforward and frustrating case of 
                        his career. How can a man be in two places at once? After the success of his "Bill Hodges" series and Sleeping Beauties, coauthored with his son Owen, 
                        King's latest feels somewhat flat and predictable. Followers of the horror master's career will likely guess the outcome early on. Usually a maestro of 
                        character development, King casts his novel with tired and one-dimensional figures, including Anderson, whose emotional development is disappointingly 
                        nonexistent. An extended cameo from a favorite past King character does little to increase the enjoyment. VERDICT King's fans may be dispirited by 
                        this latest disappointing thriller; however, his name alone will ensure it flies off the shelves. [See Prepub Alert, 12/1/17.]—Tyler Hixson, Brooklyn P.L.

                        Narrator Will Patton turns this story into an audio blockbuster. Early on, Patton sounds like he’s reading a police procedural. He uses a terse, confident 
                        voice to portray Detective Ralph Anderson, a no-nonsense meat-and-potatoes type who’d never consider a supernatural explanation for a baffling case. 
                        But Ralph’s worldview expands as he digs deeper into the brutal murder of 11-year-old Frank Peterson. When Holly Gibney, the troubled sidekick 
                        turned ace private investigator from Stephen King’s Bill Hodges Trilogy, enters the story, Patton gives her a halting speech pattern and falsetto voice. 
                        Holly’s unique sound and open-mindedness effectively contrast with the decent but sometimes hardheaded men surrounding her. King’s usual sprawling 
                        cast of characters is also present, and suffice it to say that Patton does them all justice. A.T.N. Winner of AudioFile Earphones Award, 2018 Best

                        Horrormeister King (End of Watch, 2016, etc.) serves up a juicy tale that plays at the forefront of our current phobias, setting a police procedural among 
                        the creepiest depths of the supernatural.If you're a little squeamish about worms, you're really not going to like them after accompanying King through 
                        his latest bit of mayhem. Early on, Ralph Anderson, a detective in the leafy Midwestern burg of Flint City, is forced to take on the unpleasant task of 
                        busting Terry Maitland, a popular teacher and Little League coach and solid citizen, after evidence links him to the most unpleasant violation and then 
                        murder of a young boy: "His throat was just gone," says the man who found the body. "Nothing there but a red hole. His bluejeans and underpants 
                        were pulled down to his ankles, and I saw something…." Maitland protests his innocence, even as DNA points the way toward an open-and-shut case, 
                        all the way up to the point where he leaves the stage—and it doesn't help Anderson's world-weariness when the evil doesn't stop once Terry's in the 
                        ground. Natch, there's a malevolent presence abroad, one that, after taking a few hundred pages to ferret out, will remind readers of King's early novel 
                        It. Snakes, guns, metempsychosis, gangbangers, possessed cops, side tours to jerkwater Texas towns, all figure in King's concoction, a bloodily Dantean 
                        denunciation of pedophilia. King skillfully works in references to current events (Black Lives Matter) and long-standing memes (getting plowed into by a 
                        runaway car), and he's at his best, as always, when he's painting a portrait worthy of Brueghel of the ordinary gone awry: "June Gibson happened to be 
                        the woman who had made the lasagna Arlene Peterson dumped over her head before suffering her heart attack." Indeed, but overturned lasagna pales in 
                        messiness compared to when the evil entity's head caves in "as if it had been made of papier-mâché rather than bone." And then there are those worms. 
                        Yuck.Not his best, but a spooky pleasure for King's boundless legion of fans.
