                    brother’s running out of time to find a kidney donor, and that promotion she

                    And it’s a really good letter. Like the kind that proves that Jacob isn’t actually Satan. 
                    Worse, he might be this fantastically funny and subversively likeable guy who’s 
                    terrible at first impressions. Because suddenly he and Bri are exchanging letters, 
                    sharing lunch dates in her “sob closet,” and discussing the merits of freakishly tiny 
                    horses. But when Jacob decides to give Briana the best gift imaginable—a kidney for 
                    her brother—she wonders just how she can resist this quietly sexy new doctor . . . 
                    especially when he calls in a favor she can’t refuse.

                    Bestseller Jimenez (Part of Your World) charms with this poignant and often hilarious romance between ER doctors. Briana Ortiz is initially 
                    suspicious that new hire Jacob Maddox is out to steal her promotion, but Jacob surprises her by taking himself out of the running. Both are 
                    recovering from messy breakups—Jacob with an ex who is now engaged to his brother, Briana with a husband who gaslighted her while 
                    carrying on a yearslong affair—and as they grow closer through letters, they help each other recover. However, the idea of faking a 
                    relationship to convince Jacob’s family that he’s moved on could upend their fragile dynamic. Indeed, the ensuing series of communication 
                    issues will leave readers wanting to shake some sense into Jimenez’s leads. Still, Jacob is a dream boyfriend (down to his willingness to 
                    donate a kidney for Briana’s brother), and the romantic angst rings true in light of the characters’ traumatic past relationships. The laugh-
                    out-loud scenes—including Briana’s tale of glitter-bomb revenge and the introduction of a foul-mouthed parrot—are the real highlight. 
                    Add in sparkling prose, skillful plotting, and a sensitive approach to Jacob’s clinical anxiety, and the result is contemporary romance gold. (Apr.)

                        Emergency-room doctor Briana Ortiz has a lot going on in her life. She's in the middle of a divorce, her brother has moved in because he can't 
                        (or won't) take care of himself while he waits for a kidney donor, and there's a new doctor on her rotation—one who will probably get the 
                        promotion Briana wants since he's a man. She hates him even before he breaks her phone and is rude to the nurses. Dr. Jacob Maddox is having 
                        the worst first day of work ever. It seems he can't put a foot right with the ER nurses or sexy Dr. Ortiz. Jacob isn't great with people on his best 
                        days since his social anxiety makes small talk very difficult. So, to introduce himself and apologize, he writes Briana a letter. Despite her initial 
                        irritations, she finds herself writing back. This heartfelt romantic comedy deals respectfully with mental health issues and weaves them into the 
                        story so deftly that the story would suffer without these plot points. The protagonists are also beautifully developed and feel authentic. 
                        VERDICT Fans of Jimenez (Part of Your World) will clamor for this book, and first-time readers of hers will want to explore her backlist.

                        In this contemporary romance, two emergency room doctors, both recovering from messy breakups, form a close, comforting friendship and 
                        perhaps something more.            
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        Dr. Briana Ortiz has enough on her plate. She’s in the midst of finalizing her divorce, and her brother’s on a deadline to find a kidney donor. 
                        Now she has to worry that the new doctor, Jacob Maddox, is there to nab her promotion to chief of emergency medicine. Admittedly, Jacob
                        —who has social anxiety—doesn't make the best first impression on Bri, telling her off for bumping into him in the hall. To make amends, 
                        he writes her a letter to explain himself and apologize, and the tension between them softens as their letters to each other keep coming. 
                        Bri realizes Jacob isn’t there to undermine her, and Jacob gets to see Bri’s more vulnerable side. When Jacob offers to be Bri’s brother’s 
                        kidney donor and Bri agrees to be Jacob’s pretend girlfriend for a wedding, it's easy to wonder what kept these two apart in the first place. 
                        The answer: not much. Of course, the two are carrying some heavy baggage from prior relationships, but it seems like a minor obstacle when 
                        compared to the genuine connection Jacob and Bri share. This is a cute, slow-burn romance with plenty of funny moments and emotional 
                        challenges, though the focus seems to be on the leads finally realizing what’s been in front of them all along through grand and sometimes 
                        unnecessary machinations. Did this need a fake dating subplot? Or epistolary flirting? Not really, but Jimenez manages to pepper these 
                        adorable tropes throughout without making them feel too gimmicky.
