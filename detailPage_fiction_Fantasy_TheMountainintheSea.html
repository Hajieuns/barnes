                <p>
                    For those that gravitate towards the science in science fiction, this book will make 
                    you rethink everything you ever thought you knew about intelligence and sentience. 
                    This riveting debut is a first contact story, an eco-thriller and a philosophical 
                    meditation on the nature of consciousness and what humankind will leave behind 
                    as its legacy.

                    Humankind discovers intelligent life in an octopus species with its own language

                    The octopuses hold the key to unprecedented breakthroughs in extrahuman 
                    intelligence. As Dr. Nguyen struggles to communicate with the newly discovered 
                    species, forces larger than DIANIMA close in to seize the octopuses for themselves.

                    But no one has yet asked the octopuses what they think. Or what they might do 
                    about it.

                    A near-future thriller, a meditation on the nature of consciousness, and an eco-

                    is a mind-blowing dive into the treasure and wreckage of humankind’s legacy.

                    Nayler’s masterful debut combines fascinating science and well-wrought characters to deliver a deep dive into the nature of intelligent 
                    life. Marine biologist Ha Nguyen gets the opportunity of a lifetime when she’s invited to study a recently discovered society of 
                    intelligent octopuses in Vietnam’s Con Dao archipelago. Aiding her are Evrim, the world’s first android, and Altantsetseg, a human 
                    expert drone operator, both of whom add nuance to Nayler’s thematic exploration of consciousness through their vivid personalities 
                    and backstories: Evrim’s programming gradually breaks down, leaving them contemplating the nature of self, meanwhile drones enhance 
                    Altantsetseg’s natural awareness as she uses them to both observe the octopuses in their natural habitat and defend the archipelago from 
                    rivals eager to capitalize on Nguyen’s research. Throughout, Nayler provides a tightly focused framework for the challenges Nguyen faces 
                    as she attempts to decipher octopus language and culture, which will especially please science-minded readers. Subplots featuring genius 
                    hacker Rustem and Eiko, a man trafficked into slavery aboard a fishing vessel, expertly weave into the narrative while also offering 
                    readers a broader understanding of the political and technological state of this near-future world. As entertaining as it is intellectually 
                    rigorous, this taut exploration of human—and inhuman—consciousness is a knockout. (Oct.)

                        A novel that is alert, intelligent, open."

                        “[A] staggering book . . . In all my years as a science journalist, I could never quite get my head around the so-called hard problem of 
                        consciousness . . . It wasn’t until I read Ray Nayler’s The Mountain in the Sea that I truly understood it in my bones . . . [The Mountain 
                        in the Sea] has the clothes of a futuristic, eco-punk or cyberpunk thriller, the guts of a philosophy seminar and the soul of a religious tract.”
                        —Phillip Ball, New Scientist

                    <span>
                        “Exciting, cerebral, and surprisingly compassionate, The Mountain in the Sea shines a light on the importance of our fragile ecosystem. 
                        Read this riveting novel if you love fresh takes on science fiction or you’re just fascinated by the mysteries of nature.”
                        —Apple Books Review

                    <span>
                        “Less a science-fiction adventure than a meditation on consciousness and self-awareness, the limitations of human language, and the 
                        reasons for those limitations, the novel teaches as it engages.” —Kirkus Reviews

                    <span>
                        “With a thriller heart and a sci-fi head, The Mountain in the Sea delivers a spooky, smart read. Artificial intelligence, nascent animal 
                        sentience, murderous flying drones: like the best of Gibson or Atwood, it brings all of the plot without forgetting the bigger questions 
                        of consciousness, ecocide, and scientific progress. Truly a one-of-a-kind story.”

                        “I came to The Mountain in the Sea for the cephalopods (I love cephalopods), but I stayed for the fascinating meditation on 
                        consciousness and personhood. I loved this book.”

                        “Ray Nayler has taken on the challenge of a near future that’s less certain than ever and made it gleam—not only with computer 
                        terminals and sentry drones (we love those, sure) but also polished coral and cephalopod eyes. From these pages, I got the sense of 
                        William Gibson, and Paolo Bacigalupi—and Donna Haraway, and Octavia Butler. This is a planetary science fiction and a profound 
                        new kind of adventure, featuring—among so many other wonders—the best villain I’ve read in years. In the end, the enormity and 
                        possibility of this novel’s vision shook tears loose. What a ride; what a feeling; what a future.”

                    <span>
                        “The Mountain in the Sea is a first-rate speculative thriller, by turns fascinating, brutal, powerful, and redemptive. The book poses 
                        profound questions about artificial and nonhuman intelligence, and its answers are tantalizing and provocative.”

                    <span>
                        “I loved this novel’s brain and heart, its hidden traps, sheer propulsion, ingenious world-building, and purity of commitment to luminous ideas.”

                        “The Mountain in the Sea is a wildly original, gorgeously written, unputdownable gem of a novel. Ray Nayler is one of the most exciting

                        Nayler's debut novel of speculative fiction laced with cyberpunk elements and environmentalism is set against coastal Asia on future-Earth. 
                        The most prominent of the novel's three interwoven narratives features Ha Nguyen, a cephalopod researcher; Evrim, the world's only 
                        android with manufactured consciousness; and Altantsetseg, a technologically advanced security guard. All are on the mysterious Con Dao 
                        Archipelago research facility, which has been cordoned off from outsiders to hide the octopus consortium living in surrounding waters. 
                        The trio aims to confirm that the consortium communicates among itself, and they are also determined to bridge the communication gap 
                        between humans and another species. The remaining two narratives follow a sophisticated hacker sent to breach Evrim's mind and enslaved 
                        people aboard an AI-controlled fishing vessel who are poaching the ocean's creatures. The multiple narrative threads, coupled with quotes from 
                        fictional books (written by the characters) at the beginning of each chapter, make for challenging narratorial work, but despite the hard-to-follow 
                        transitions, Eunice Wong remains polished. VERDICT This slow-burning novel strikes a balance between hard- and soft-speculative fiction without 
                        being too heady or obtuse and would be a sound addition to any library's collection.—Kym Goering

                        DEBUT A community of intelligent octopuses has been discovered off the southern coast of Vietnam. Access to the animals is tightly controlled by 
                        the international corporation DIANIMA, which hopes to study and exploit the octopuses for their development of artificially intelligent androids. 
                        They hire Dr. Ha Nguyen, an expert on cephalopods, to lead the research into the octopuses' language and culture. It quickly becomes clear that 
                        DIANIMA's plans to cash in on the results of Dr. Nguyen's efforts is not something the octopuses agree with—and no one can foresee what the 
                        octopuses will do to make their resistance understood. VERDICT Drawing on decades of experience in overseas service (including time with the 
                        United States Consulate in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam), Nayler infuses his debut novel with fantastic elements grounded in real contemporary 
                        topics and tackles moral issues related to artificial and animal intelligence without sacrificing plot or pacing. This is a classic sci-fi thriller that's 
                        easy to read and will have broad appeal for fans of speculative fiction.—Lydia Fletcher

                        In the not-too-distant future, a marine biologist specializing in cephalopod intelligence discovers a species of octopus with astonishing language 
                        skills—research that a giant corporation wants to monetize.

                        Dr. Ha Nguyen is so amazed by her findings that she's willing to submit herself to the odious tactics of the big tech company, which controls the 
                        Vietnamese island where the octopuses dwell. Having "resettled" the population of the Con Dao Archipelago, the company not only will kill any 
                        outsiders who attempt to set foot there, but also has ordered Ha's death should she attempt to leave. Not that she has any inclination to do so. 
                        Once exposed to the octopuses, she is determined to uncover the great mysteries of extrahuman intelligence. In spite of their hostile reputation, 
                        these are creatures of transcendent beauty, communicating through glowing visual symbols that move on their skin in complex patterns and 
                        sequences. In a world of robot-operated slave ships, bee-size drones, and AI automonks with three-fingered hands and light receptors for pupils, 
                        her main ally is Evrim, the world's first and possibly last true android, which not only thinks like a human being, but also believes it is conscious. 
                        Ha's benefactor and adversary is Dr. Arnkatla Mínervudóttir-Chan, the Icelandic brains of the corporation, whose ultimate goal is to create a 
                        mind "wiped clean of its limitations." A prolific writer of SF stories making his debut as a novelist, Nayler maintains a cool, cerebral tone that 
                        matches up with the story's eerie underpinnings. Less an SF adventure than a meditation on consciousness and self-awareness, the limitations of 
                        human language, and the reasons for those limitations, the novel teaches as it engages.
