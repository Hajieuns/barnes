                    The New York Times bestselling true story of an all-American girl, a boy from 
                    Zimbabwe, and the letter that changed both of their lives forever.         
                </p>
                <p>
                    It started as an assignment. Caitlin had never even heard of Zimbabwe when 
                    everyone in her class was told to write a letter to an unknown student somewhere in 
                    a distant place. Excited for the first time about homework, she went home that night 
                    and wrote about her favorite color and what sports she played, and asked her 
                    mystery pen-pal about life in Zimbabwe.         
                </p>
                <p>
                    Martin had never heard of Pennsylvania when he read Caitlin’s letter. He was lucky 
                    to even receive a pen-pal letter—his class only received ten letters for fifty kids! But 
                    as the top student, he got the first one. He wrote Caitlin back, talking about his 
                    siblings and soccer and saying he hoped she wrote again.        
                </p>
                <p>
                    These letters were the beginning of a correspondence that spanned six years and 
                    changed two lives. In this compelling dual memoir, Caitlin and Martin recount how 
                    they became best friends—and better people—through their inspiring long-distance 
                    exchange.

                    "Caitlin and Martin seemed to have nothing in common—except a curiosity about the world outside their own and a willingness to reach out to each other. 
                    With a lot of postage and a lot more hope, these two pen pals changed each other's lives and the lives of everyone who knew them. An inspiring story that 
                    will change your life, too."—Patricia McCormick, author of the National Book Award finalist Sold

                        …the remarkable tenacity of these two souls pulled like magnets across the world by their opposite polarities—one committed to helping, the other to 
                        surviving—is deeply affecting. There is no way to read their account without feeling vulnerable to just that stab at sympathy that started their story. 
                        It is quite a little miracle of unexpected genuineness.

                        In 1997, a 12-year old girl from Hatfield, Pa., and a 14-year-old boy from Mutare, Zimbabwe, began a pen-pal relationship. In alternating chapters, 
                        Alifirenka and Ganda recount how their mutual curiosity led to an increasingly honest, generous correspondence. Martin loves receiving Caitlin's photo,
                         but when she requests one in return, "My heart went from sprinting to a standstill." He sends her the only photo his family owns. Hearing BBC accounts
                         of Zimbabwe's political and economic turmoil alarms Caitlin, but a letter written on a popsicle wrapper shocks her: "I gasped. My friend was writing 
                        me on trash." She begins to send him her babysitting money—which Martin's family uses to buy food and to pay school fees and rent—and Caitlin's 
                        family eventually decides to sponsor Martin's education. Sensitively and candidly demonstrating how small actions can result in enormous change, this 
                        memoir of two families' transformation through the commitment and affection of long-distance friends will humble and inspire. Ages 12–up. Agent:

                        Gr 6 Up—The true story of two young pen pals who forge a life-altering connection. In 1997, Caitlin, a typical 12-year-old girl from a middle class 
                        American family, began writing to Martin, a studious 14-year-old from a Zimbabwe slum. In her letters, Caitlin described her life, which consisted of
                         shopping trips, quarrels with friends, and problems at school. Martin was initially far more circumspect in his responses. Inflation had rocketed in
                         Zimbabwe, and even finding money for postage was a struggle for the boy. Staying in school, which required paying costly fees, became merely a dream.
                         Eventually, Martin revealed the harsh realities of his life to Caitlin, who began sending money and gifts. What started as chatty letters turned into a 
                        lifeline for Martin and his family, as Caitlin and her parents helped the boy stay in school and achieve his goal of studying at an American university.
                         This is a well-written, accessible story that will open Western adolescents' eyes to life in developing countries. Told in the first person, with chapters 
                        alternating between Caitlin's and Martin's points of view, this title effectively conveys both of these young people's perspectives. Caitlin's early chapters, 
                        however, in which she discusses friendship and boyfriend woes, feel somewhat superficial compared with Martin's genuinely troubled life. While these 
                        chapters provide an effective contrast between the two teens' lives, they may discourage some readers from continuing with what becomes a strong and 
                        inspiring story. VERDICT A useful addition to most collections and an eye-opening look at life in another culture.

                        A pen-pal correspondence between an American girl and a Zimbabwean boy blossoms into a lifelong friendship. In alternating chapters, the authors relate 
                        their story, which begins in 1997 when 12-year-old Caitlin chooses a boy in Zimbabwe for a pen-pal assignment. Caitlin's privileged life in Pennsylvania 
                        differs tremendously from Martin's hardscrabble life in millworkers' housing, where his family shares one room with another one. The top student in his 
                        class, Martin dreams of studying at an American university, but even just continuing high school in Zimbabwe seems like a long shot. Caitlin, not 
                        recognizing the extent of Martin's poverty, sends some of her babysitting money with her letters, and Martin's family uses it for food. Eventually, 
                        Caitlin and her parents become Martin's sponsors for his studies and help him obtain a scholarship to Villanova University in 2003. Written with 
                        journalist Welch, the heartfelt recollections read like an overlong magazine article. The early chapters in particular have the inauthentic feel of 
                        sentimentalized adult reminiscence, and they accentuate the difference between an American whose eyes are open to the value of international friendship
                         and her less-enlightened classmates. The action builds toward the happy climax of Martin's arrival in the United States, but at the same time, it conveys 
                        a sense of the power of do-gooder, take-charge Americans to effect change. A feel-good, message-driven book that may appeal to adults more than teens.
