                    The Roaring Twenties—the Jazz Age—has been characterized as a time of Gatsby 
                    frivolity. But it was also the height of the uniquely American hate group, the Ku 
                    Klux Klan. Their domain was not the old Confederacy, but the Heartland and the 
                    West. They hated Blacks, Jews, Catholics and immigrants in equal measure, and 
                    took radical steps to keep these people from the American promise. And the man 
                    who set in motion their takeover of great swaths of America was a charismatic 
                    charlatan named D.C. Stephenson.

                    Stephenson was a magnetic presence whose life story changed with every telling. 
                    Within two years of his arrival in Indiana, he’d become the Grand Dragon of the 
                    state and the architect of the strategy that brought the group out of the shadows – 
                    their message endorsed from the pulpits of local churches, spread at family picnics 
                    and town celebrations. Judges, prosecutors, ministers, governors and senators 
                    across the country all proudly proclaimed their membership. But at the peak of his 
                    influence, it was a seemingly powerless woman – Madge Oberholtzer – who would 
                    reveal his secret cruelties, and whose deathbed testimony finally brought the Klan 
                    to their knees.

                    The shocking story of how Ku Klux Klan leader David C. Stephenson seized and lost control of the state of Indiana in the 1920s is told 
                    in Pulitzer winner Egan’s evocative latest (after A Pilgrimage to Eternity). An itinerant newspaperman and petty criminal, Stephenson 
                    took charge of Klan recruiting efforts across the Midwest and was named Grand Dragon of the Realm of Indiana in 1923. Buoyed by 
                    skyrocketing enrollment numbers—by 1925, “one in three native-born white males wore the sheets,” Egan writes—Stephenson effectively 
                    ran Indiana, controlling the governor, both houses of the state legislature, and a private police force of 30,000 men, which he utilized to 
                    “harass violators of Klan-certified virtue.” Though journalists and others sought to counteract the Klan’s influence, Stephenson’s power 
                    remained unchecked until he kidnapped and raped a Department of Public Instruction employee named Madge Oberholtzer in 1925. 
                    During the incident, Oberholtzer dosed herself with bichloride of mercury; she died an agonizingly slow death 29 days later, but not before 
                    she dictated a full account of Stephenson’s crimes. Convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison, Stephenson became a 
                    symbol of the Klan’s cruelty, hypocrisy, and corruption, and the organization’s grip on Midwestern politics crumbled. Dramatic twists of fate
                     and vivid character sketches distinguish this harrowing look at a forgotten chapter of American history. It’s a certifiable page-turner. (Apr.)

                        National Book Award and Pulitzer Prize winner Egan (The Worst Hard Time) exposes a 1920s American political scene filled with characters 
                        and themes that resonate today. He unmasks anti-Black, anti-immigrant, antisemitic, fearful, evangelical, hate-filled, resentful, and xenophobic 
                        white supremacists desperate to "save" the country. He focuses on David Curtis "D.C." Stephenson (1891–1966), a magnetic charlatan with 
                        Napoleonic visions that included becoming a U.S. senator and more. Twenty-seven chapters document Stephenson's rise from a Ku Klux Klan 
                        recruiter in Evansville, IN (then the country's most racially segregated city), to Grand Dragon of Indiana, the largest KKK realm ever, with a 
                        reputed 400,000 members. Nationally, the KKK included congresspeople, governors, state legislators, county and local officials, police, and 
                        more. The book details KKK insider personalities, locally and nationally, along with their corruption, scheming, and squabbling for control, 
                        money, and power. The book also chronicles Stephenson's fall as he approached the apex of power when, in a sensational and noteworthy 
                        trial, he was convicted of abducting, raping, and murdering Indiana Department of Public Instruction lending library manager Madge 
                        Oberholtzer (1896–1925). VERDICT Egan's riveting page-turner offers profound insights to readers willing to peer into layers of American 
                        hypocrisy, intolerance, malignant indifference, and public culpability.—Thomas J. Davis

                        A winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award chronicles a dark period when the Ku Klux Klan was ascendant.

                        In 1866, in a small town in Tennessee, six White war veterans formed a secret brotherhood to share their disgust about the emancipation 
                        of Blacks. By 1868, the Klan had 500,000 members “in every province of the former Confederacy.” By the 1920s, the Klan’s raids, beatings, 
                        lynchings, and arson had spread throughout the country. It was, Egan writes in his shocking, horrifying history, the “largest and most 
                        powerful of the secret societies among American men.” Klan members included ministers, politicians, judges, policemen, bankers, and 
                        businessmen, united in their belief in White supremacy and their virulent hatred of immigrants, Jews, Roman Catholics, and Blacks. 
                        Central to Egan’s narrative is David C. Stephenson, bluff and arrogant, a manipulator and liar, a vicious sexual predator, a “carouser, 
                        a gasbag, a petty thief” who demanded unconditional adoration from his lackeys. Charming when it suited him, ruthless toward his 
                        enemies, he harbored an insatiable lust for power. Stephenson’s “unbridled energy” fueled the exponential growth of the Klan in 
                        Indiana, where, he boasted, “I am the law.” Klan members filled positions at every level of government, and Stephenson himself 
                        aimed for a presidential run. Klan vigilantes rampaged on morality patrols, and the group allied with the eugenics movement to pass 
                        the nation’s first forced sterilization law. In 1924, Congress, filled with Klan members, passed the National Origins Act, vastly limiting 
                        immigration. Egan reveals the bold efforts of journalists, lawyers, and Black and Jewish leaders to oppose the Klan despite being 
                        threatened constantly. He also reveals the scandals and infighting that imperiled Stephenson’s position—until one woman’s 
                        deathbed testimony took him down. The Klan’s grievances, the nation’s polarization, and a blustering politician who saw efforts 
                        to bring him to justice as a “hoax and witch hunt”: This riveting history seem disturbingly familiar and undeniably chilling.

                        There's a reason why Timothy Egan is a Pulitzer-Prize-winning reporter and author of numerous bestsellers. He knows how to find an interesting 
                        story and tell it well. The rise and fall of the Ku Klux Klan in the American Heartland of the 1920s is one of those true-life dramas that history 
                        seems to have forgotten. Fortunately, Egan brings his rigorous journalistic chops to this fascinating story. As a narrator, Egan has enough material
                         to work with--including the violent, racist con man D.C. Stephenson and the woman who brought him down, Madge Oberholtzer--to keep 
                        listeners engaged. This is the story of a sad and disturbing part of American history. It is an important listen that informs and engages. J.P.S. ©
