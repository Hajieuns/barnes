                <p>
                    We confess, we got a little spoiled in 2021 with the release of not one but TWO 
                    Penny penned books. A year is complete when we know we are going to spend some 
                    time with Armand Gamache. A World of Curiosities continues Penny’s empathetic 
                    investigation into the human condition. We are in good hands with Armand 
                    Gamache and the residents of Three Pines.

                <p>    INSTANT #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER</p>

                <p>
                    Chief Inspector Armand Gamache returns in the eighteenth book in #1 New York 
                    Times bestseller Louise Penny's beloved series.       
                </p>
                <p>
                    It’s spring and Three Pines is reemerging after the harsh winter. But not everything 
                    buried should come alive again. Not everything lying dormant should reemerge.     
                </p>
                <p>
                    But something has.     
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the villagers prepare for a special celebration, Armand Gamache and Jean-Guy 
                    Beauvoir find themselves increasingly worried. A young man and woman have 
                    reappeared in the Sûreté du Québec investigators’ lives after many years. The two 
                    were young children when their troubled mother was murdered, leaving them 
                    damaged, shattered. Now they’ve arrived in the village of Three Pines.        
                </p>
                <p>
                    But to what end?    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gamache and Beauvoir’s memories of that tragic case, the one that first brought 
                    them together, come rushing back. Did their mother’s murder hurt them beyond 
                    repair? Have those terrible wounds, buried for decades, festered and are now about 
                    to erupt?       
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Chief Inspector Gamache works to uncover answers, his alarm grows when a 
                    letter written by a long dead stone mason is discovered. In it the man describes his 
                    terror when bricking up an attic room somewhere in the village. Every word of the 
                    160-year-old letter is filled with dread. When the room is found, the villagers decide 
                    to open it up.           
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the bricks are removed, Gamache, Beauvoir and the villagers discover a world of 
                    curiosities. But the head of homicide soon realizes there’s more in that room than 
                    meets the eye. There are puzzles within puzzles, and hidden messages warning of 
                    mayhem and revenge.                              
                </p>
                <p>
                    In unsealing that room, an old enemy is released into their world. Into their lives. 
                    And into the very heart of Armand Gamache’s home.

                    Bestseller Penny’s virtuoso 18th novel featuring Chief Insp. Armand Gamache of the Québec Sûreté (after 2021’s The Madness of Crowds) blends 
                    nuanced characterization with nail-biting suspense. Siblings Fiona and Sam Arsenault return to Three Pines more than a decade after Gamache 
                    investigated the bludgeoning murder of their mother, Clotilde. His inquiry revealed that Clotilde had prostituted her children, then 13 and 10, at 
                    the time of the killing. During the case, he met his future number two and son-in-law, Jean-Guy Beauvoir, who came to a different conclusion than 
                    his own. Gamache stayed involved in Fiona’s life, even aiding her graduate studies in engineering. The Arsenaults’ arrival coincides with several 
                    murders, which seem connected to an unusual painting found concealed in a hidden room in Three Pines. It first appears to be a duplicate of The 
                    Paston Treasure, a cryptic 17th-century assemblage of items known as A World of Curiosities, but anachronistic elements, such as a digital watch, 
                    have been added. Penny adds crucial details about Gamache’s backstory and satisfactorily resolves a plotline tease from earlier in the series. This tale 
                    of forgiveness and redemption will resonate with many. Agent: David Gernert, Gernert Company. (Nov.)

                        “Penny delves into the nature of evil, sensitively exploring the impact of the dreadful events she describes while bringing a warmth and humanity

                        “Another superb achievement… Penny weaves together all these narratives—the series of modern-day killings, the decade-old bludgeoning murder 
                        and the haunting artwork that has remained shrouded in mystery across the centuries—with a master’s deft hand.” —BookPage (starred review)

                    <span>
                        “For Penny, the novel is a narrative tour de force, drawing brilliantly on some dark moments in Québec history and leading Gamache and the

                        In 1989, a young Armand Gamache was on the scene of a mass slaying when 14 women were killed at Montreal's École Polytechnique. It 
                        changed his life and propelled him into a career in homicide. Ten years later, while investigating Clotilde Arsenault's murder, Gamache recruited 
                        an angry, undisciplined officer, Jean-Guy Beauvoir. Both events trigger current events in 2019. Gamache and his wife, Reine-Marie, took Clotilde's 
                        daughter, Fiona, under their wing, although she and her brother, Sam, were involved in their mother's death. After Fiona graduates from the École 
                        Polytechnique, she and Sam head to Three Pines. Gamache sees an evil in Sam that he only ever saw in a serial killer in prison for life. However, it's 
                        a mysterious painting, bricked up in a house in Three Pines, that sends Gamache on a search into the past, looking into his own heart for the fears 
                        that threaten the people he loves. With newcomers to Three Pines, the Arsenaults' history, and the secrets hidden behind the wall, danger is closer 
                        than Gamache imagines. VERDICT Penny's 18th Gamache novel (after All the Devils Are Here) is intense as the detective digs deep into his own fears.

                        Robert Bathurst performs this 18th Inspector Gamache mystery with the assurance of one who knows the village of Three Pines and its (mostly) gentle 
                        residents well. Years after Gamache and Beauvoir investigated the murder of a mother, her two adult children arrive in the village. Their surprise arrival 
                        triggers Gamache’s and Beauvoir’s remembrances of things past. Penny’s clever plotting is enhanced by Bathurst’s ability to make even the smallest details 
                        relevant. A hidden attic room containing a duplicate of a seventeenth-century painting with small anachronistic items hidden within the images provides 
                        clues to solving a series of brutal murders. Bathurst weaves several timelines together seamlessly to create an exciting tapestry revealing crimes against 
                        women, child abuse, revenge, and murder. Fans are in for a treat. S.J.H. Winner of AudioFile Earphones Award © AudioFile 2022, Portland, Maine

                        Welcome to Three Pines, the idyllic-seeming Canadian capital of murder.    
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        At the heart of Penny’s series of mysteries set in the tiny Quebec town of Three Pines is the relationship between Chief Inspector Armand Gamache, the 
                        empathetic and capable head of homicide for the Sûreté du Québec, and his headstrong second-in-command, Jean-Guy Beauvoir, now also his son-in-law. 
                        Gamache has a talent for finding officers who’ve been languishing in their previous jobs and turning them into trusted allies, and Penny has frequently 
                        mentioned the way Beauvoir had been “banished to the basement” in an out-of-the-way bureau and that there was something “lean and feral…something 
                        dangerous” about him before Gamache swooped in and brought him to the homicide squad. Now, in her 18th installment, Penny flashes back to the case 
                        that brought the two men together. A woman named Clotilde Arsenault has been found dead in a remote lake, and Gamache shows up at the local 
                        detachment to investigate the case himself. Clotilde had two children, 13-year-old Fiona and Sam, 10, and it turns out she had been prostituting them. 
                        In the book’s present-day strand, Fiona is graduating from college after having served time in prison for killing her mother; Gamache and his wife, 
                        Reine-Marie, have supported her, almost folding her into their own family, but they’ve never trusted Sam, who will also be at the graduation ceremony. 
                        This chapter in Penny's chronicle of Three Pines contains all the elements that she sometimes divides up between different books: There's a cozy-feeling 
                        present-day mystery concerning a hidden room Fiona discovers by looking at the roofline of Myrna's bookstore, and the strange painting found inside; 
                        the harrowing story of how Gamache and Beauvoir cracked the case of Clotilde's murder; and a story of corruption within the institutions that are 
                        supposed to be protecting us. The plotting is complex and the characters as vivid as ever, but the opportunity to watch Gamache and Beauvoir's 
                        relationship develop is what makes this book one of Penny's best.

                        Penny will have you turning the pages as fast as you can to see how she'll manage to tie everything together.
