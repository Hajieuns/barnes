                <p>
                    Ruta Sepetys is a masterful historical fiction author, and I Must Betray You is no 
                    exception. Set in the not-too-distant past — 1989, to be exact — I Must Betray You 
                    follows 17-year-old Cristian Florescu in Communist Romania as he grapples with 
                    his newfound position as an informant for the secret police. This page-turning step 
                    into the past will give readers insight into a time many know little about.

                    Romania, 1989. Communist regimes are crumbling across Europe. Seventeen-year-
                    old Cristian Florescu dreams of becoming a writer, but Romanians aren’t free to 
                    dream; they are bound by rules and force.        
                </p>
                <p>
                    Amidst the tyrannical dictatorship of Nicolae Ceaușescu in a country governed by 
                    isolation and fear, Cristian is blackmailed by the secret police to become an informer. 
                    He’s left with only two choices: betray everyone and everything he loves—or use his 
                    position to creatively undermine the most notoriously evil dictator in Eastern 
                    Europe.         
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cristian risks everything to unmask the truth behind the regime, give voice to fellow 
                    Romanians, and expose to the world what is happening in his country. He eagerly 
                    joins the revolution to fight for change when the time arrives. But what is the cost 
                    of freedom?

                        Gr 9 Up—Sepetys's latest book maintains the caliber readers have come to expect from an author whose focus on hidden histories has made her a YA 
                        powerhouse of historical fiction. Cristian is a 17-year-old living in Romania in 1989 with his family in the sterile concrete block housing that Ceausescu's 
                        communist state allows, with little to eat and no liberties. When Cristian reluctantly agrees to become an informer to protect his grandfather, nothing is 
                        sacred: not his budding relationship with Liliana, not his friendship with Luca, and not his musings about Romania in a notebook that will be a tool to
                         fight back, if he makes that choice. Romania blossoms under Sepetys's attention to detail which comes from personal interviews, archival research, and
                         traveling. These complexities are then infused into the setting and cast of characters whose surveillance means betrayal lurks everywhere, evidenced 
                        by the secret reports resourcefully sprinkled into the narrative. Mysterious as it is thrilling, the book's short chapters create an atmosphere of impending 
                        danger leading to a historical event in Eastern Europe that may be unknown to many yet is necessary to be told. The impending revolution pressurizes 
                        Cristian's next move, reminiscent of Matt Killeen's Orphan Monster Spy that blurs the line of good and evil. VERDICT Sepetys is a formidable writer,
                         and her stories declare the need to write about global issues of social injustice. For that reason and her attention to detail, this is a must-read.—Alicia Abdul

                        Narrator Edoardo Ballerini masterfully conveys the unrelenting stress on 17-year-old Cristian Florescu, who lives in Bucharest, Romania, in the winter of 
                        1989. Ballerini makes the totalitarian regime of Nicolae Ceausescu palpable, as well as Cristian’s adoration of his Bunu, his loving grandfather. To save 
                        the ailing man, Cristian agrees to take on an informer role in exchange for medicine. But instead of relief, Cristian experiences a tightening noose of 
                        hunger, isolation, and fear. Ballerini portrays a complex character whose passion for poetry and philosophy, first crush, and love of family contrast with
                         the betrayal he’s willing to commit. Ballerini’s pacing enhances the suspense and twists in this first-person narrative. Ruta Sepetys’s straightforward back

                        A rare look at the youth-led rebellion that toppled Romania’s Ceaușescu.
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        Seventeen-year-old Cristian Florescu, with his spiky hair, love of poetry and English, and crush on Liliana Pavel, is as much of a rebel as it’s possible to be 
                        in Bucharest, Romania, in 1989. Communist dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu has been in power for 24 years, and most Romanians live in poverty, exporting 
                        what they produce to unknowingly fund Ceaușescu’s obscenely extravagant lifestyle. Wild dogs attack children in the streets, and secret agents are 
                        everywhere. When an agent confronts Cristian with evidence of treason—a single dollar bill tucked inside his notebook—and also offers medicine for 
                        Bunu, his sick grandfather, Cristian agrees to spy on the American diplomat family whose son he’s become friendly with. But as young Romanians
                         gradually become aware that other countries have gained freedom from communism, they rise up in an unconquerable wave. Sepetys brilliantly 
                        blends a staggering amount of research with heart, craft, and insight in a way very few writers can. Told from Cristian’s point of view, intercut by 
                        secret police memos and Cristian’s own poetry, the novel crackles with energy; Cristian and his friends join the groundswell of young Romanians, 
                        combining pragmatism, subterfuge, hope, and daring. While the story ends with joy on Christmas Day, the epilogue recounts the betrayals and 
                        losses that follow. The last line will leave readers gasping.
