                <p>
                    No Strangers Here is a procedural mystery set in Ireland featuring two characters 
                    and a partnership banter that is unforced, complicated and even funny at some 
                    points. This is a story that’s easy to fall for, and quickly.

                    On a rocky beach in the southwest of Ireland, the body of a wealthy racehorse owner 
                    Johnny O’Reilly has been discovered. In a town like Dingle, everyone knows a little 
                    something about everyone else. But dig a bit deeper, and there’s always much more 
                    to find. And when Detective Inspector Cormac O'Brien is dispatched out of Killarney 
                    to lead the murder inquiry, he's determined to unearth every last buried secret.

                    Dimpna Wilde hasn’t been home in years. But faced with a triple bombshell—her 
                    mother is rumored to have been in a relationship with Johnny, her father’s dementia 
                    is escalating, and her brother is avoiding her calls—Dimpna moves back to Dingle to 
                    clear her family of suspicion. And as she takes over the family practice, she finds 
                    herself in a race with the detective inspector to uncover the dark, twisting truth 
                    behind murder, no matter how close to home it strikes...

                <p>
                    <strong>Carlene O’Connor</strong> is the USA Today bestselling author of the acclaimed Irish 
                    Village Mysteries, the County Kerry Novels, and the Home to Ireland Mysteries. 
                    Born into a long line of Irish storytellers, her great-grandmother emigrated from 
                    Ireland filled with tales in 1897 and the stories have been flowing ever since. Of all 
                    the places she’s wandered across the pond, she fell most in love with a walled town 
                    in County Limerick and was inspired to create the town of Kilbane, County Cork, 
                    the setting of her Irish Village Mystery series. She is a member of Mystery Writers of 
                    America and Sisters in Crime, and currently divides her time between New Mexico 
                    and the Emerald Isle. Please visit her online at CarleneOConnor.net.

                    County Kerry.”

                    In a tightknit Irish town, the body of Johnny O'Reilly, the town's richest man, is found staged on a local beach. The only clues are black 
                    stones spelling out "Last Dance," a tarot card, a syringe containing veterinary euthanasia medication, and small footprints leading away 
                    from the scene. Recently transferred DI Cormac O'Brien, ignorant of the local lore and characters, is dependent upon longtime DS Neely 
                    for context. The O'Reilly family is determined to point O'Brien in the direction of local veterinarian Dr. Wilde, due to longstanding family 
                    grudges. Alerted to the situation by a friend and former police officer, Wilde's daughter Dimpna, also a veterinarian, reluctantly returns home 
                    after a long absence to find her father not only a suspect in a murder, but also sadly losing his memory and incapable of maintaining his practice. 
                    She steps into his practice and the murder investigation. Cormac and Dimpna navigate the clues and uncover answers to long held secrets. 
                    VERDICT Known for her cozies, O'Connor ("Home to Ireland" and "Irish Village" series) moves into darker territory here. For fans of Louise Penny.

                    After 27 years, veterinarian Dimpna Wilde comes back to the Irish village of Dingle to help clear her parents, who have been accused of murdering 
                    the village’s wealthiest man, Johnny O’Reilly. Narrator Emily O’Mahony portrays many characters, all of whom have motives. She is at her best as 
                    Dimpna and as Cormac O’Brien, the detective who is investigating the case. Her rich Irish accent gives the story more depth, especially in the 
                    flashbacks, which describe Dimpna’s childhood connection to Johnny. Her children’s voices are filled with excitement and fear as she enacts the prank 
                    played on Dimpna, which relates to the murder. This first installment in the Irish Vet Mysteries is a clever mix of suspense, charm, and love.

                        Ireland's County Kerry provides the backdrop for O’Connor’s compelling series kickoff.            
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        DI Cormac O’Brien, who’s new to Dingle, must depend on the locals for insight when the body of racehorse owner Johnny O’Reilly is found on a beach 
                        along with 69 black stones spelling out the words "Last Dance." O'Reilly was 69 years old, too. DS Neely provides Cormac with background on Last 
                        Dance, one of O’Reilly’s horses that was killed in a road accident more than 25 years earlier. It's clear that O’Reilly was murdered elsewhere and his 
                        body brought to the beach in a boat. Only a child’s footprints are found nearby. Bucking the powers that be to work the case, Cormac learns that the 
                        O’Reillys and the family of Eamon Wilde, their veterinarian, have a complex history that could have led to murder. Eamon shows signs of dementia; 
                        his wife, Maeve, who used to go dancing with O'Reilly, reads tarot cards. Their son, Donnecha, who serves as caretaker of O’Reilly’s yachts, is a bit 
                        of a wild one. But it’s their daughter, Dr. Dimpna Wilde, that Cormac finds most fascinating. A talented veterinarian, tiny and beautiful, she’s the 
                        widow of a man who killed himself after swindling hundreds of Dubliners out of their life savings. Unable to pay her bills when her assets are seized, 
                        she returns to Dingle to help her father’s practice and try to extricate her family from a murder charge. Dimpna’s past is about to be torn wide open, 
                        revealing various crimes, including her rape by Johnny’s son Sean O’Reilly, and the revelation that what she remembers is not always the truth.

                        Exciting, convoluted, and rich with compelling characters, this is the best of O’Connor’s Irish mysteries to date.
