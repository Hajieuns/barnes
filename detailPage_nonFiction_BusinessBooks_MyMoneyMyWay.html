                    My Money My Way is a practical money management system from the creator of 
                    the hugely successful blog Budget Mom.

                    Does fear and insecurity keep you from looking at your bank account? Is your

                <p>
                    As a newly divorced single mom making $24,000 per year and facing down $77,000 
                    in debt, Kumiko Love worried constantly about money. She saw what other moms 
                    had—vacations, birthday parties, a house full of furniture—and felt ashamed that 
                    she and her son lived in a small apartment and ate dinner on the floor. Worse, when 
                    her feelings began to exhaust her, she binge-shopped, reasoning that she’d feel better 
                    after a trip to the mall.       
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the day she needed to pay for a McDonald’s ice cream cone without her credit 
                    card, she had an epiphany: Money is not the problem. Self-Doubt is the problem. 
                    Shame is the problem. Guilt is the problem. Society’s expectations for her are the 
                    problem. She is the solution.         
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once she reversed the negative thinking patterns pushing her toward decisions that 
                    didn’t serve her values or goals, her financial plan wrote itself. Now, she’s not only 
                    living debt-free in her dream home, which she paid for in cash, but she has spread 
                    her teachings around the world and helped countless women envision better lives for 
                    themselves and their families.

                <p>
                    Now, building on the lessons she’s taught millions as the founder of The Budget 
                    Mom, she shares a step by step plan for taking control back over your financial life
                    —regardless of your level of income or your credit card balance. Through stories 
                    from navigating divorce to helping clients thrive through recessions, depression, 
                    eviction, layoffs and so much more, you will learn foundational practices such as:

                    control you
                    How to create a budget based on your real life, not a life of self-denial
                    How to create a motivating debt pay-off plan that makes you excited about your 
                    future, instead of fearing it

                    My Money My Way will give you the tools to align your emotional health with your 
                    financial health—to let go of deprivation and embrace desire. Love’s paradigm-
                    shifting system will teach you how to honor your unique personal values, driving 
                    emotions, and particular needs so that you can stop worrying about money and start

                    “Society’s expectations are the problem. You are the solution,” writes financial counselor Love in her empowering debut, a guide for “women 
                    who have lost their way with their finances.” A single mother who was financially strapped after her divorce, Love realized that her debt was 
                    tied up with emotional baggage that needed to be addressed before she could effectively tackle it; her wake-up call was when she had to pay 
                    for a $1.09 McDonald’s ice cream cone for her son with a credit card. Her guidance focuses on the emotions surrounding money—namely 
                    shame, fear, and anxiety. She walks readers through beating worry by finding their “why” (the person or thing that inspires them) and asks 
                    them to consider how they want their money to serve them. Once that’s established, she helps them “take back control” of their lives using 
                    her “Budget by Paycheck” method, a system that combines self-examination, a budget, and a calendar to keep track of cashflow. There areb
                    plenty of stories from other women in the “Budget Mom family,” and, thanks to Love’s “you can do it” message, there’s no shortage of 
                    encouragement on offer. This pragmatic, caring guide is perfect for women looking to shape up their financial picture. (Feb.)
