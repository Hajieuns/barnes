                <p>
                    Acclaimed journalists James Stewart and Rachel Abrams have written the definitive 
                    account of Paramount and the Redstone family. There's enough drama here for a 
                    hit show or movie, with all the generous helpings of money, greed and power you 
                    would expect from a blockbuster.

                    family, and the dysfunction, misconduct, and deceit that threatened the future of the

                <p>
                    As one of the last in a long line of all-powerful media moguls, Sumner had been a 
                    relentlessly demanding boss, and an even more demanding father. When his 
                    daughter, Shari, took control of her father’s business, she faced the hostility of 
                    boards and management who for years had heard Sumner disparage her. Les 
                    Moonves, the popular CEO of CBS, felt particularly threatened and schemed with 
                    his allies on the board to strip Shari of power. But while he publicly battled Shari, 
                    news began to leak that Moonves had been involved in multiple instances of sexual 
                    misconduct, and he began working behind the scenes to try to make the stories 
                    disappear.

                    Family Legacy, written with New York Times media reporter Rachel Abrams, joins his earlier probing work on the Walt Disney Co., 
                    insider trading, corporate lawyers and the posh netherworld of American business. Imagine a mash-up of King Lear and Weekend at 
                    Bernie’s, the 1989 movie comedy about two scamps who prop up a cadaver so they can enjoy a weekend at his beach house, with 
                    Redstone starring in both title roles.” —The Wall Street Journal

                    “Has a business book ever made you blush? . . . There’s the 90-something billionaire with still-active ‘sexual appetites’; 
                    the scheming mistresses; threesomes; parked-car encounters; a Sedona love nest; a chief executive who allegedly forced himself on 
                    multiple victims; a stolen laptop; shady private investigators; and a cast of characters straight off MTV or another Redstone cable 
                    channel. Mixing tight financial reporting with soap-operatic twists and turns, Unscripted makes the amped-up historical fiction of 
                    Babylon feel downright chaste by comparison . . . Media insiders and those who followed the Redstone saga will eat this reporting—
                    and some of the other, more comical twists that populate the book—up . . . Unscripted delivers the good.” —The Washington Post

                        If you need a tale of intrigue, infighting, and crime that makes the Trump White House look like a bastion of normalcy, this is it. Veteran 
                        reporters Stewart and Abrams uncover the untoward doings of the heads of CBS and Viacom: Les Moonves, “the first chief executive of a 
                        major publicly traded company forced to resign for predatory sexual conduct,” and Sumner Redstone, a much-feared business leader who 
                        threw it all away to satisfy his own urges. Then in his ninth decade and, by the authors’ account, in evident decline, Redstone courted 
                        women young enough to be his granddaughters—and never mind that he had grandchildren of his own who were on the way to being bilked 
                        out of their inheritances by two of his paramours, who, one bragged, “could get [him] to do pretty much whatever she wanted.” Amid all the
                         sexual and financial misadventures came a complex dance to merge the two corporations. “Given Sumner’s mental state and communication 
                        issues,” the authors write, “it’s hard to know how much of the intricacies of the proposed Paramount deal he knew or understood.” Enter 
                        Redstone’s often estranged daughter, Shari, a sharp negotiator and sole hero of this book, who went up against both her father and Moonves,
                         cleaned house on the domestic and corporate fronts, and, amid a flurry of lawsuits, prevailed. Moonves and the parasites were gone, and the 
                        newly restructured Paramount was emergent, if well behind Netflix and Amazon, in the streaming-services market. To call it sordid is to 
                        undervalue the word, but Stewart and Abrams serve up a sharp-pointed morality tale that excoriates a corporate culture—now on the way to 
                        extinction, one hopes—that “had largely ignored the misconduct of so many rich and 
                        powerful men so long as they delivered profits and higher stock prices.”
