                    Set against the backdrop of a wealthy oceanside town, The Agathas follows two 
                    teenage girls — rich and popular Alice Ogilvie and her less popular, less rich tutor, 
                    Iris Adams — as they work together to solve the murder of Alice’s ex-best friend. 
                    With all signs pointing to one person, the girls consult the complete works of the 
                    master herself, Agatha Christie, to help uncover the truth once and for all.

                    Last summer, Alice Ogilvie’s basketball-star boyfriend Steve dumped her. Then she 
                    disappeared for five days. She's not talking, so where she went and what happened 
                    to her is the biggest mystery in Castle Cove. Or it was, at least. But now, another 
                    one of Steve’s girlfriends has vanished: Brooke Donovan, Alice’s ex–best friend. And 
                    it doesn’t look like Brooke will be coming back. . .      
                </p>
                <p>
                    Enter Iris Adams, Alice’s tutor. Iris has her own reasons for wanting to disappear, 
                    though unlike Alice, she doesn’t have the money or the means. That could be 
                    changed by the hefty reward Brooke’s grandmother is offering to anyone who can 
                    share information about her granddaughter’s whereabouts. The police are convinced 
                    Steve is the culprit, but Alice isn’t so sure, and with Iris on her side, she just might 
                    be able to prove her theory.        
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to get the reward and prove Steve’s innocence, they need to figure out who 
                    killed Brooke Donovan. And luckily Alice has exactly what they need—the complete 
                    works of Agatha Christie. If there’s anyone that can teach the girls how to solve a 
                    mystery it’s the master herself. But the town of Castle Cove holds many secrets, and 
                    Alice and Iris have no idea how much danger they're about to walk into.

                    Alice Ogilvie is one of the rich, popular kids who rule California’s Castle Cove High. After basketball star Steve Anderson dumps her for her best 
                    friend, Brooke Donovan, Alice vanishes without a trace for five days, hoping to garner sympathy and attention. Then Alice reappears unscathed, 
                    and everyone is furious; she endures months of house arrest as punishment, then returns to school a pariah, prompting her to crash the in-crowd’s
                     Halloween bash. Her appearance causes Brooke to flee, en route passing Alice’s tutor, Iris Adams, who is out walking. But when Brooke misses 
                    school the next day, and most people think she just “pulled an Ogilvie,” Iris and Alice unite to find her—Alice out of guilt and a desire to use the 
                    detective skills she learned reading Agatha Christie, and Iris for the reward money offered by Brooke’s grandmother. Iris and Alice co-narrate, 
                    allowing Glasgow (You’d Be Home Now) and Lawson (The Lucky Ones) to fully develop both characters. Despite an outlandish denouement 
                    that undercuts the story’s impact, the mystery thrills and gratifies thanks to escalating stakes and devastating reveals. Subplots involving domestic 
                    abuse and parental neglect confer depth. Most characters cue as white. Ages 14–up. Agents: (for Glasgow) Julie Stevenson, Massie and McQuilkin 
                    Literary; (for Lawson) Andrea Morrison, Writers House. (May)

                        Gr 9 Up—One small, coastal Californian town has a lot of terrible history. Castle Cove has had its share of missing people, loss of fortune, and 
                        unexplained deaths. The town was just settling back down after Alice's runaway stunt the previous summer and now her ex-best friend, Brooke, 
                        is missing. Brooke isn't just any Castle Cove citizen, but the granddaughter of billionaire make-up icon Lillian Levy. It still takes the police a bit 
                        too long to really start the search, thanks to Alice's antics. Alice's parents aren't around a lot, even after she was missing for days, so she's been 
                        matched up with a peer tutor to make sure her academic work gets back on track. Lucky for Iris, peer tutoring comes with a paycheck which she
                         desperately needs to get her and her mom out of Castle Cove as soon as possible. The unlikely friendship between Iris and Alice forms as they 
                        study, search for Brooke, and learn more about each other than either was willing to reveal. Alice's obsession with the OG mystery queen, Agatha
                         Christie, is intertwined in her POV chapters and adds charm to this mystery that is reminiscent of Karen M. McManus's work. VERDICT A 
                        great title to add to high school mystery shelves to satiate those readers who are hungry for thrillers featuring characters their own age.

                        Seething at the oddly lackadaisical response of local police to the disappearance of her former BFF on Halloween, 17-year-old Agatha Christie fan 
                        Alice Ogilvie enlists Iris Adams, her peer tutor, to launch an inquiry that not only bears immediate fruit in the form of a battered corpse at the base 
                        of nearby seaside cliffs, but leads to a veritable flood of obvious but conflicting clues and revelations that point to, and away from, foul play. Which
                         was it? As the two gather and struggle to make sense of their evidence in traded-off chapters (with help from a squad of enthusiastic would-be fellow
                         sleuths and a savvy public defender with flexible ethics), readers quickly twig to the fact that they themselves are nursing secrets. Along with frequent
                         references to Christie’s books and tumultuous personal history, the co-authors stir in classic mystery tropes and complications aplenty. Though evidently 
                        all White, the students at Castle Cove High are split between fabulously wealthy A-listers and working-class kids; as events speed along to a surprise 
                        denouement (albeit not in a drawing room) with a violent but decisive resolution, class tensions play out, sometimes viciously, between the protagonists
                         as they warily circle one another on the way to a firm bond.
