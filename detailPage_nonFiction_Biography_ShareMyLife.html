                <p>
                    Kem makes soul music and now shares his soul in this beautiful and compassionate 
                    autobiography. You will be inspired as he shares his personal testimony.    
                </p>
                <p class="bold">
                    Grammy Award–nominated artist Kem shares his life in this revealing and 
                    remarkable memoir tracing his transformative journey from homelessness to gold-
                    selling artist.              
                </p>
                <p>
                    Known for his smooth affecting crooning and dapper style, Kem’s journey to the 
                    stage is nothing short of inspiring. In Share My Life, Kem goes back to the very 
                    beginning before his time to introduce his grandmother who worked as a 
                    sharecropper in the South and had thirteen children. As Kem’s family rises from the 
                    sharecropping and ultimately lands in Detroit, there is an unspoken mantra of “hard 
                    things are better left unsaid,” which has devastating consequences down the line. 
                    And so, Kem grows up in the midst of an impenetrable silence. His mother is never 
                    without a beer in her hand, and his relationship with his father is oddly tense. 
                    Emotionally starved, Kem internalizes harmful feelings, eventually spiraling to drug 
                    use in his search for relief.        
                </p>
                <p>
                    At nineteen, Kem is homeless, roaming the cold Detroit streets. In the overly bright
                    AA halls, Kem comes across men like himself verbalizing their feelings. The 
                   meetings helped him discover his own voice, using music as an outlet that has since 
                   touched millions.         
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Share My Life, Kem chronicles his incredible journey of self-discovery. The young 
                    boy who struggled with feelings of worthlessness becomes a man willing to put 
                    everything on the line for his dream.

                    Grammy-nominated R&B singer Kem debuts with a frank assessment of his struggles with addiction and the shame and “mask” 
                    of silence that fed his dysfunction. The narrative opens with Kem on the hunt for whatever substance might help him “descend into darkness 
                    numb out,” and then flashes backward, charting his course from rural Tennessee to Detroit, and from “a painfully shy kid bent on self-destruction 
                    to someone who performs original songs in front of appreciative fans.” He recounts the rocky path he took to stardom, including 
                    his stint in the short-lived R&B group Wild Pair, a latent belief in his own voice, and a brush with homelessness. Eventually, he writes, AA 
                    eetings pushed him toward self-expression and jump-started his recovery and career trajectory. Throughout, Kem is candid about the 
                    discrepancy between his lyrics and his troubled romantic relationships, and he dives headfirst into the complexities of his various interracial 
                    relationships. The takeaway is triumphant: music heals Kem, and his climb to the top is captivating and inspirational. Fans and non-fans alike 
                    will be moved. Agent: David Vigliano, Vigliano Assoc. (Apr.)

                        Raised in Detroit by distant, troubled parents, artist Kem learned quickly that "hard things are better left unsaid," which left him homeless at 
                        19 as he coped with internalized pain by using drugs. Here he recounts his journey from that hard beginning to renown as an R&B singer/
                        songwriter with multiple Grammy Awards to his credit.

                        Making his book debut with a raw memoir, three-time Grammy nominee Kem, assisted by veteran music writer and co-author Ritz, recounts 
                        his rocky journey from self-destructive behavior to professional acclaim. Born Kim Owens in 1969, Kem was a shy child who felt unloved by 
                        his father and often ignored by his mother, who, for many years, was a functioning alcoholic. By the time he was a teenager, he tried to dull his 
                        pain with drugs and alcohol. In high school, he recalls, “smoking weed and drinking beer became an every-day thing. Sometimes before school, 
                        sometimes after. My dependency grew gradually but steadily.” He remembers his senior year through an “alcoholic fog.” After his father threw 
                        him out, he lived on the streets, stealing, lying, and “sinking into a quicksand of self-loathing.” When he landed in a Salvation Army shelter, he
                        knew he had hit rock bottom. One of the residents knew, too, and urged Kem to attend a Twelve Steps meeting with him. It proved transformative. 
                        The program “was the first time in my life when I was consciously aware of searching for something. I was searching to better myself. Searching for 
                        a way to stop the hemorrhaging, the bleeding out of my life into this bottomless pit of despair.” Kem made a commitment to sobriety that, he realizes, 
                        “depends on daily spiritual maintenance,” including prayer, meditation, and music, which had always been a passion. He found inspiration in New 
                        Age churches, where he heard “God’s inspiration in all music.” Marianne Williamson, senior minister at one church, invited him to join her choir, 
                        which turned out to be an exhilarating experience for him and led to other public performances. In the 1990s, determined to write an album, he 
                        began an arduous process “to unearth the music buried in my heart”—a process that has earned him many accolades.
