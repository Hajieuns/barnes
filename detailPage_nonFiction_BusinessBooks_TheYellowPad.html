                <p class="bold nonunder">
                    Robert Rubin, former secretary of the Treasury and co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, 
                    shares thoughts on decision-making developed over more than six decades in 
                    markets, business, government, and politics, and offers readers an astute and original 
                    guide for navigating uncertain times  
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1958, as a college sophomore, Robert Rubin took a class that changed his life. 
                    The class was introduction to philosophy, and the professor, Raphael Demos, 
                    instilled in his students an idea that was simple yet profound: There is no such thing 
                    as certainty. For Rubin, this led to a critically important question: How can we make 
                    sound decisions in a fundamentally uncertain world?        
                </p>
                <p>
                    While serving in some of the most significant roles in markets, business, and 
                    government, Rubin has grappled with that question. Time and again, when faced
                     with a high-stakes decision, he turned to his most trusted tool: a simple yellow legal 
                    pad. Rubin’s yellow pad (or more recently, his iPad) became an expression of a larger 
                    decision-making philosophy that has both lasted and shaped a lifetime. In The Yello
                    w Pad, Rubin lays out that philosophy with depth and detail, and presents a compel
                    ling intellectual framework for confronting some of the most difficult issues we face 
                    today.         
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Yellow Pad contains a former Treasury secretary’s approach to economic 
                    policymaking. A former Goldman Sachs senior partner’s approach to personal 
                    investing and understanding risk. A former director of the National Economic 
                    Council’s approach to managing people in both private- and public-sector 
                    organizations. And much more. Yet despite his lifetime of experiences, Rubin 
                    remains refreshingly open-minded, interested in exploring ideas rather than 
                    promoting ideologies. With its combination of wisdom and relevance, The Yellow 
                    Pad is an essential guide for anyone looking to make better decisions in life, work, 
                    and public policy.

                <p>
                    <strong>Robert E. Rubin</strong> served as the 70th U.S. Treasury Secretary from 1995 to 1999, after 
                    serving as the first director of the White House National Economic Council. In these 
                    roles, he helped achieve the first federal budget surplus in a generation, address 
                    international financial crises, and resolve a debt-ceiling standoff, among much else. 
                    Rubin is the author of In an Uncertain World: Tough Choices from Wall Street to 
                    Washington, a New York Times bestseller. He spent twenty-six years at Goldman 
                    Sachs, rising to co-senior partner, and was a senior counselor and board member at 
                    Citigroup. He currently serves as counselor to the independent investment advisory 
                    firm Centerview Partners, as co-chairman emeritus of the Council on Foreign 
                    Relations, and as chair of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation. Rubin is a 
                    founder of The Hamilton Project, at the Brookings Institution, which promotes 
                    broad-based economic growth. A former member of the Harvard Corporation, he 
                    graduated from Harvard summa cum laude and from Yale Law School.

                    Evaluating probability is key to navigating the complexities and uncertainties of modern life, contends Rubin (In an 
                    Uncertain World), former U.S. Treasury Secretary and cochairman of Goldman Sachs, in this earnest if flawed offering. 
                    He shares how he’s made major professional decisions by writing on a yellow legal pad “a list of possible outcomes in one 
                    column, and my estimated odds of each outcome occurring in the other,” and then choosing the option promising the greatest 
                    reward at the highest probability. Recognizing how biases influence decision-making is crucial, he argues, noting how his 
                    awareness of his risk aversion enables him to compensate for when he overweighs risk in his tabulations. However, the yellow 
                    pad approach sometimes gets dropped in favor of dubiously relevant anecdotes from Rubin’s career, such as when he recounts 
                    adopting a more supportive stance toward his colleagues to make the jump from arbitrage to management at Goldman Sachs, a 
                    change that had little to do with navigating uncertainties. Additionally, the dry prose dulls the impact of stories from the author’s 
                    extraordinary career (even an account of a Goldman Sachs partner’s arrest for insider trading falls flat). Torn between a standard 
                    business memoir and a broader program for navigating uncertainty, this struggles to find its footing. (May)

                        A sometimes repetitive but generally useful manual on introducing cost-benefit analysis to decision-making.   
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        “We need an effective intellectual framework for thinking about thinking—an approach to the world that acknowledges complexity and 
                        uncertainty but can nonetheless help us make the best possible decisions,” writes Rubin, a former Treasury secretary and Goldman Sachs 
                        executive. There’s a lot packed into that suggestion, for acknowledging that complexity and uncertainty involves introducing risk analysis 
                        into decisions of import, which entails probabilistic thinking (What are the chances this is going to fail?), which involves the old economists’ 
                        trick of cost-benefit analysis, which circles back to risk. One does all this, Rubin counsels, by means of a yellow legal pad, a metaphor for 
                        any means of listing possible outcomes for reckoning honestly with key questions: “How do you make judgments about the probabilities? 
                        How do you consider trade-offs when priorities conflict? And how do you deal with potential scenarios that can’t be expressed in numerical 
                        terms?” Rubin is a qualitative thinker, but he admits that some qualitative assessment boils down simply to gut reactions. Though he belabors 
                        certain points, he makes subtle arguments about the dangers of, for instance, assuming that low risk means no risk and the desirability of 
                        leaders who care less about whether they’re popular than whether they make their best effort to get things right. In that regard, he branches 
                        out to leadership style, notably Bill Clinton’s, who was inclined to make decisions while taking a wide range of opinions that weren’t 
                        necessarily weighted toward the seniority of the person offering them. That approach relies on “embracing human complexity: recognizing 
                        and engaging with the inherent strengths, weaknesses, and motivations of individuals, and then working to give them the best chance to succeed.” 
                        And never skip the important step of asking “foundational questions.”          
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        With intellectual heft and plenty of actionable items, this is a smart prescription for better thinking.

                        As Secretary of the Treasury in the last decade of the 20th century, Robert Rubin presided over what we can now see as an unusually prosperous 
                        and stable era in American life. Now, drawing on his years in government and in the private sector, Rubin offers us an astute, valuable, and 
                        illuminating guide to decision-making and, in a sense, to life itself in an uncertain world." —Jon Meacham, author of And There Was Light: 
                        Abraham Lincoln and the American Struggle      
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        “Robert Rubin’s exuberant praise for a classics professor who taught him how to think about thinking in a world of uncertainty is a powerful 
                        reminder of the importance of studying humanities. This engaging, eloquent, and accessible work provides an invaluable guide not only for 
                        decision makers in government and business but for all of us in our daily lives.” —Doris Kearns Goodwin, author of Leadership: In Turbulent Times              
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        “In The Yellow Pad, Bob Rubin makes the compelling case for pragmatism over emotion and ideology, and offers practical advice for everyone 
                        who has to make difficult decisions in a complicated world.” —Anne Applebaum, author of Twilight of Democracy: 
                        The Seductive Lure of Authoritarianism       
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        “Nobody has been in the middle of more economic policy decision-making for longer than Bob Rubin. Readers are lucky to get his great 
                        perspectives and principles in his new book “The Yellow Pad” and are sure to find them useful as they face their own tough choices.” 
                        —Ray Dalio, Founder of Bridgewater Associates, author of Principles   
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        “From the wisdom he learned in a college course in philosophy to the lessons he picked up during a lifetime in government and banking,
                        Robert Rubin has crafted a powerful tool for dealing in a world of uncertainty. This book explains how to use ‘probabilistic thinking.’  
                       It’s a very interesting idea, and also one that’s useful for business and for life. I wish I’d known this years ago!” 
                       —Walter Isaacson, Professor of History at Tulane University, author of The Code Breaker     
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        "The Yellow Pad offers an outstanding collection of lessons learned during a lifetime of leadership on Wall Street and in Washington. 
                        It is indispensable for navigating challenges and making decisions in difficult times." —Ken Chenault, Chairman and Managing 
                        Director of General Catalyst, former Chairman and CEO of American Express
