                <p>
                    This is Clint Smith’s latest book of poetry since 2016’s Counting Descent. Since 
                    then, many of us became familiar with his writing through the brilliant How the 
                    Word is Passed. Or maybe it’s his work for The Atlantic magazine. Smith has a way 
                    with words – to inform, inspire and push us to know the world and ourselves better. 
                    The poetry in Above Ground does all that. We are big fans of anyone who helps set 
                    our sights with compassion and an open heart to each other.                    
                </p>

                    A remarkable poetry collection with "inextinguishable generosity and abundant 
                    wisdom" (Monica Youn) from Clint Smith, the #1 New York Times bestselling and 
                    National Book Critics Circle award-winning author of How the Word Is Passed.                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Clint Smith’s vibrant and compelling new collection traverses the vast emotional 
                    terrain of fatherhood, and explores how becoming a parent has recalibrated his 
                    sense of the world. There are poems that interrogate the ways our lives are shaped 
                    by both personal lineages and historical institutions. There are poems that revel in 
                    the wonder of discovering the world anew through the eyes of your children, as they 
                    discover it for the first time. There are poems that meditate on what it means to raise 
                    a family in a world filled with constant social and political tumult. Above Ground 
                    wrestles with how we hold wonder and despair in the same hands, how we carry 
                    intimate moments of joy and a collective sense of mourning in the same body. 
                    Smith’s lyrical, narrative poems bring the reader on a journey not only through the 
                    early years of his children’s lives, but through the changing world in which they are 
                    growing up—through the changing world of which we are all a part.

                <p>
                    I think there is an emergent theory, and maybe also a demand, when Clint Smith considers the brutalizing facts and language of war 
                    almost alongside a reverie about sprinkling sand on his baby’s feet; when he mourns the long and brutal and ongoing history of 
                    American slavery almost alongside making French toast with the kids or dancing until the whole family falls down.  When he makes 
                    us witness the most incomprehensibly awful (and daily) brutalities not only beside but almost in tandem with the most incomprehensibly 
                    tender (and daily) actions of care.  It’s a theory, and a demand, to which I think we must pay very close attention.”
                    —Ross Gay, author of Inciting Joy                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Clint Smith is a brilliant poet, one who knows ‘we are not all left / standing after the war has ended. Some of us have become ghosts,’ 
                    who knows that ‘you come from the parachute that didn't open — / and then did.’—and who finds words to sing and to mourn, and to 
                    see us for who we are. Here is a poet who offers wisdom that ‘our bodies  have / always been inexpricable vessels of energy we can / not 
                    control,’ and despite that (or perhaps because of it), also offers grace. This is a beautiful, vivid book, where ‘grandfather is a fist / full of 
                    embers’ and a dance party becomes a life-giving ceremony, and Andromeda Galaxy, 2.5 million light years away, is a reason enough to 
                    spark an love note. Much to love in this poetry collection, lyric keeping us above the ground, rooted into our world, blessed to be alive, 
                    despite it all. Clint Smith is a marvelous poet.”—Ilya Kaminsky, author of Deaf Republic and Dancing in Odessa
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I’m so grateful that Clint Smith’s poems remind us of our interdependence on each other—on chrysanthemums, jellyfish, plankton, to note 
                    just a few of his magnificent poetic negotiations—all while turning his wide and generous eyes to fatherhood. This book is an illumination 
                    I sorely needed of both the outdoors and the quotidian—a joyful embrace and legacy of bright language and poignant questions.”

                    “Clint Smith’s poems make palpable the soap-bubble thinness of borders—the contingent boundaries of love and loss, past and present, 
                    sanctuary and violence, ‘us’ and ‘them.’ With inextinguishable generosity and abundant wisdom, he shows us the linkages that both bind 
                    and divide us—as family, as community, as nation, as world: ‘The river that gives us water to drink is the same one that might wash us away.’ 
                    I am so grateful for these luminous poems.

                    “Clint’s Smith’s Above Ground gives us one of our most urgent writers at the height of his powers. With these poems, Smith’s crystalline lyric 
                    illuminates every word with love’s deep regard. It’s so nourishing, the scope and hope and breadth of Smith’s tenderness. I recommend this book 
                    for everyone who has ever been a parent or a child, in love or beloved. I recommend it to everyone who has ever felt like a stranger inside of 
                    history, inside of a nation, or inside their own heart.”—Kaveh Akbar, author of Pilgrim Bell

                    "A gorgeous book...Smith’s pivots and pacing mirror the routes of our lives, and his gentle, attentive poems are downright sacramental....
                    I appreciate poets like Smith who turn the page between hope and loss, fear and exuberance."—Nick Ripatrazone, The Millions

                    "When poet and Atlantic staff writer Clint Smith became a dad, it changed how he saw the world. With his second book of poetry, the father of 
                    two attempts to put all of his complicated feelings surrounding parenthood into perspective. Whether it be the utter joy of watching his children 
                    make new discoveries or the heartbreak of knowing you can’t always protect your little ones from social injustice, the author of How the Word 
                    is Passed doesn’t sugarcoat the emotional rollercoaster that most parents are on. Above Ground is a beautiful meditation not only on Smith’s own 
                    journey as a dad, but also on the effect our ever-changing world has on the way we raise our children."—Time, "23 Most Anticipated Books of 2023"

                    History of Slavery Across America, one of the best books of the past two years...In 2023, he’s back, this time with a poetry collection intimately

                    "I long for a literature—especially a poetry—of joy; life is too short and bland without it. Smith’s new poetry collection teems with images of 
                    love and fatherhood. Great poetry comes in many modes and subjects, but there’s something unique about a book of verse that makes me want 
                    to hold my own children a little tighter, as I think of his description of delivering a bear hug: 'my arms are still / open like a universe / in need of 
                    a planet / to make it worth / something.' Juxtaposed with lines of grief and recognition—“men attempting / to unlearn the anger on their father’s 
                    / tongues, the heat in their hands”—Smith’s songs of joy are that much sweeter."—The Millions, "Most Anticipated"

                    "Coming off of his bestselling nonfiction book from 2021, Clint Smith is back with a gorgeous collection of poetry exploring fatherhood. The 
                    Harvard grad interrogates how parenthood shapes the lives of both the parents and the children, and he wrestles with the ways history, social 
                    and political events affect raising children. A constantly changing world can be hard to grasp as an individual, but one of our most prolific 
                    writers gives us language through his lyrical prose."—Christian Burno, WBUR/NPR Boston ("Winter Books Guide")

                    “This is Clint Smith’s latest book of poetry since 2016’s Counting Descent. Since then, many of us became familiar with his writing through the 
                    brilliant How the Word is Passed. Or maybe it’s his work for The Atlantic magazine. Smith has a way with words – to inform, inspire and push 
                    us to know the world and ourselves better. The poetry in Above Ground does all that. We are big fans of anyone who helps set our sights with 
                    compassion and an open heart to each other.”—Barnes & Noble, "Most Anticipated for March"

                    changed how he moves through the world. These poems delve into the heartbreak and pain of raising children in a broken world, as well as the 
                    moments of transcendent joy that come with parenthood."—Laura Sackton, Book Riot, ("Best Poetry Books of 2023")

                        Smith, whose How the Word Is Passed won the 2021 nonfiction National Book Critics Circle Award, returns to poetry in this, his second collection 
                        (after Counting Descent). His focus here is on Black fatherhood and the immense responsibility that parenting entails ("When I speak to my son I 
                        carry/ the echo of generations") when the "moral arc of the universe/ does not bend in a direction that comforts us." As he watches his young 
                        children grow—fragile blossoms of wonder and beauty amid the world's chaos and violence—he wonders how he can protect them, writing: 
                        "I am trying to inhale all the smoke/ from this burning world while/ asking you to hold your breath." In candid lyric poems often written in 
                        direct address to his son and daughter, Smith exquisitely captures the anxiety, love, uncertainty, and joy that accompany the challenge of 
                        nurturing nascent human lives, all the while casting a nervous eye on the unstable natural, social, and political environments they'll inherit. 
                        VERDICT While this collection will resonate most deeply with parents, its wisdom, humanity, and sheer eloquence speak to a time and 
                        condition all readers will recognize.—Fred Muratori

                        Clint Smith's poems are deep, resonant, and well crafted. He delivers them with a clear understanding of their meaning and how to bring that 
                        meaning to listeners. His works explore various aspects of fatherhood from experiencing the early stages of a first pregnancy to managing 
                        two toddlers. Some of the experiences Smith chronicles are specific to Black families, but many are not, and most of the audiobook will resonate 
                        with parents of all backgrounds. Smith's tone is confiding and welcoming. Parenthood is not an event but a process, and this collection gives 
                        listeners a vivid picture of the beginning of that story. D.M.H. © AudioFile 2023, Portland, Maine
