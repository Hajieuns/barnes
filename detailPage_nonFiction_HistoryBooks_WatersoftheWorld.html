                    The compelling and adventurous stories of seven pioneering scientists who were at

                    From the glaciers of the Alps to the towering cumulonimbus clouds of the 
                    Caribbean and the unexpectedly chaotic flows of the North Atlantic, Waters of the

                    underappreciated idea: that the Earth has a global climate system made up of 
                    interconnected parts, constantly changing on all scales of both time and space. A 
                    prerequisite for the discovery of global warming and climate change, this idea was 
                    forged by scientists studying water in its myriad forms. This is their story.

                    Linking the history of the planet with the lives of those who studied it, Sarah Dry 
                    follows the remarkable scientists who summited volcanic peaks to peer through an 
                    atmosphere’s worth of water vapor, cored mile-thick ice sheets to uncover the 
                    Earth’s ancient climate history, and flew inside storm clouds to understand how 
                    small changes in energy can produce both massive storms and the general 
                    circulation of the Earth’s atmosphere. Each toiled on his or her own corner of the 
                    planetary puzzle. Gradually, their cumulative discoveries coalesced into a unified 
                    working theory of our planet’s climate.

                    We now call this field climate science, and in recent years it has provoked great 
                    passions, anxieties, and warnings. But no less than the object of its study, the 
                    science of water and climate is—and always has been—evolving. By revealing the 
                    complexity of this history, Waters of the World delivers a better understanding of 
                    our planet’s climate at a time when we need it the most.

                    "In a very limited nutshell, the story of how we, today, have meteorological forecasts that are getting nearer and nearer to being correct is down to 
                    astronomers, simple old time sailor logic, men dabbling in weather research, the British Raj, and the attempt to predict the Monsoon after several 
                    years of famine. It all makes a fantastic compilation."

                        In this cleverly argued and brilliantly written history, Dry traces the interaction between the dramatic careers of six major figures in the history of
                        climatology and the uneven and surprising emergence of a science of climate since the mid-nineteenth century. The book illuminates its history with
                        tales of mountain climbing and dramatic voyages, of tell-tale ice cores and threatening hurricanes. No set of stories could be more urgent now and 
                       in need of the care and intelligence with which they are told here. In showing how the focus of these engaging and energetic scientists and their many 
                       colleagues gradually shifted from a collective search for the principles of a global climate system to visions of dynamic, interactive, and unstable 
                       climates in change, this book has much to teach about the roots of the most reliable knowledge of climate and how it should be best understood 
                       in its full historical and cultural setting.

                        "Dry, a historian, can't resist including those personal exploits that make such good stories: John Tyndall setting stakes in a glacier, Joanne
                         Malkus (later Simpson) flying a DC3 into tropical clouds, Willi Dansgaard collecting rain samples in his backyard through the course of a 
                        storm. But she is equally fond of the writings in which each of her protagonists describes the relationship of their scientific life to their personal, 
                        intellectual, and spiritual life. And she lingers over the moments in history when the scientific paradigm shifted: from cosmology, to meteorology,
                         to climatology, to climate science. I would love to have written this book."

                        most beautifully written books on science that I have seen in a long time. It is one thing to communicate this complex and important topic 
                       lucidly, but quite another to make the material seductive, poetic, enthralling. I was left wanting to read John Tyndall’s writings on ice, to hear 
                       the epic creak of Alpine glaciers, to go cloud-spotting off Tenerife and float turnips in Scottish lochs. Describing one of the most vital but least
                        visible histories in modern science, and rescuing from neglect a host of pioneers 
                       who helped us to see how our planet works, it is a remarkable achievement.

                         primarily static and geographical to a concept connoting change over time. What has become ‘climate science’ today is a synthesis of 
                        geology, oceanography, atmospheric physics, meteorology, glaciology, and computer science across more than a century of scientific

                        In compelling portraits of six scientists and their work, Dry probes the origins of what we now call climate science. She brings alive 
                        scientific mysteries about glaciers, clouds, oceans and the atmosphere to show how our present understanding of climate as a complex 
                        global system developed over the last 170 years. It’s a brilliant historical jigsaw puzzle, revealing how big questions about our planet 
                        have evolved and interlocked. But more than this, she makes a powerful argument about what it means to study the earth. Our knowledge 
                        of our planet, and our place on it, grew from concerns and assumptions that are as dynamic and full of change as the natural phenomena 
                        we study. How are we driven to ask the questions about nature that we do? Dry’s answers take us to the human heart of science. Exploring 
                        her subjects with unfailing insight, she brings each individual set of intellectual passions into focus. Stepping gracefully from Victorian 
                        England to late twentieth-century Greenland, her biographies illuminate the combination of speculation, observation, calculation, and 
                        assumptions that have shaped science at different moments in the past. As she says, global visions come from individuals, particular places 
                        and moments in time. Such a profoundly human account of knowledge-building may be our best guide to thinking about the planet’s future.

                        "The stories cover nearly 200 years of history, and along the way, Dry builds a clear and cogent picture of Earth’s climate system from the 
                        different disciplinary foundations of her chosen characters. It is unusual for a history book to contribute to the readers’ appreciation and
                         knowledge of both science and history, but Dry has accomplished that... I highly recommend it. I think experts and nonscientists will 
                        enjoy the read, and both will gain perspective they didn’t have before."

                        "In the eight detailed, immensely readable essays of Waters of the World, Dry shows how over the past 150 years scientists have slowly 
                        come to see climate as a global system, and to recognize how human activity contributes to changes in the complex interactions of ice, 
                        oceans, and the atmosphere. . . . Dry looks beneath her subjects’ masks with sympathy and curiosity. Noting their shared sense of a quest, 
                        at once playful and serious, in the end she turns back to the reader: 'They each, in their own way, sought something deeply meaningful 
                        from their engagement with the planet. So should we all.'"

                        move heat from tropics to poles and that drive ocean and air currents are analyzed in a masterful, entertaining way. It becomes clear that Earth 
                        operates as a complex and turbulent machine. Waters of the World chronicles how much we have learned, how much we don’t know,
                         and how much we need to learn if we are to halt the pace of global warming."

                       interwoven. Perhaps here is where Dry is onto something. Maybe our grasp of that connectedness will be the key to facing climate change,

                        British science historian Dry (The Newton Papers; The Strange) delves into the work of scientists and explorers who were key in developing the still 
                        fairly new (her subjects were born between 1819 and 1923) discipline of climate science using a biographical approach. Dry focuses on eccentric 
                        Victorian scientist and glacier adventurer John Tyndall, who looked at water as the vehicle for climate. The author's lyrical discussion of Charles 
                        Piazzi Smyth, one of the first to study clouds deeply, brings in both literary and historical allusions. Dry notes that computer pioneer Charles 
                        Babbage performed some study of climate aspects as well, and also covers how the advent of aviation seriously advanced climatology, as 
                        researchers such as Joanne and Herbert Riehl used aircraft to make observations of hurricanes and other natural phenomena. Near the end 
                        of the book is a fascinating look at meteorologist France Bretherton's now famous social process diagram of systems underpinning human 
                        influence on global climate change.
