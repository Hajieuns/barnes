                    Aza Holmes never intended to pursue the disappearance of fugitive billionaire 
                    Russell Pickett, but there’s a hundred-thousand-dollar reward at stake and her Best 
                    and Most Fearless Friend, Daisy, is eager to investigate. So together, they navigate
                     the short distance and broad divides that separate them from Pickett’s son Davis.

                    Aza is trying. She is trying to be a good daughter, a good friend, a good student,

                    of her own thoughts.

                    “This novel is by far [Green’s] most difficult to read. It’s also his most astonishing. . . . So surprising and moving and true that I became 
                    completely unstrung. . . . One needn’t be suffering like Aza to identify with it. One need only be human.”

                    “Damn near genius . . . The Fault in Our Stars is a love story, one of the most genuine and moving ones in recent American fiction, 
                    but it’s also an existential tragedy of tremendous intelligence and courage and sadness.” —Lev Grossman, TIME Magazine

                        …Turtles All the Way Down is somehow far darker [than The Fault in Our Stars], not so much because of the subject matter—though that's dark 
                        too—but because of how [Green] chooses to write about it. This novel is by far his most difficult to read. It's also his most astonishing…We spend
                         long stretches inside Aza's head, listening to [her] swift and unsteady thoughts…her mind…in the throes of a civil war…If Green were writing in 
                        his usual register, he'd interrupt Aza's descents into these cognitive spirals…with a bit of humor. But he seems to have made a decision: If Aza can't
                         find relief, neither can we…If an author has integrity, [his novel] should end plausibly. Green has integrity. He also has O.C.D. He's tweeted about
                         it; he's discussed it on his famous video blog…I still wasn't prepared for the ending of this novel. It's so surprising and moving and true that 
                        I became completely unstrung, incapable of reading it to my husband without breaking down. One needn't be suffering like Aza to identify with it. 
                        One need only be human. Everyone, at some point, knows what it's like when the mind develops a mind of its own.

                        Like many of Green's characters, Aza Holmes is whip smart, articulate, and tortured by worry. When she was eight, her father succumbed to a heart
                        attack while mowing the lawn. Now 16, Aza takes meds (irregularly) to treat anxiety, which is manifesting in increasingly self-destructive ways. Her
                        problems amplify when she reconnects with Davis, a boy she met years earlier at "Sad Camp," where both had gone to grieve their recently deceased 
                       parents. Now Davis's billionaire father is missing, running from a warrant for his arrest. Aza's best friend Daisy, in a classic sidekick role, pressures 
                       Aza to contact Davis, hoping they'll learn something about the disappearance—and maybe get a cut of the $100,000 reward. The reunion leads to 
                       romance, until Aza's anxiety won't allow it. Green's first novel since The Fault in Our Stars is another heartbreaker, full of intelligent questions. It's 
                       also a very writerly book, as Aza frames a lot of the questions she asks herself in literary terms. Am I a fiction? Who is in charge of my story? Why do
                        we describe pain with the language of metaphor? Because of this, it's tempting to conflate Aza the character with her author, who has been open 
                       about his own mental illness. But readers need not know where the line is between the two to feel for someone trapped in an irrational, fear-driven 
                       spiral. In an age where troubling events happen almost weekly, this deeply empathetic novel about learning to live with demons and love one's 
                       imperfect self is timely and important. Ages 14–up. Agent: Jodi Reamer, Writers House. (Oct.)

                        Popular author John Green’s story is inspired by his own suffering with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Narrator Kate Rudd dramatizes the quick 
                        intelligence and high anxiety of high school junior Aza Holmes, who has an incapacitating fear of being infected with a deadly bacteria. Rudd 
                        offers poignant pictures of Aza’s struggles through vivid portrayals of other characters. She colors Aza’s mother with restrained worry and fierce 
                        protectiveness and gives a steady, calming voice to wealthy Davis, Aza’s old friend and potential new boyfriend. She paints Aza’s oldest friend,
                         Daisy, with animated concern and, sometimes, frustration. Rudd expresses most strongly Aza’s sarcastic inner voice, which is so developed that 
                        it becomes a character. The convincing portrayals makes it easy to see how Aza is hindered in loving, thinking, and living without fear. S.W.

                        Nerdfighter Green's latest takes readers through Indianapolis and the human biome.Aza Holmes doesn't feel like herself. But "if half the cells inside of 
                        you are not you, doesn't that challenge the whole notion of me as a singular pronoun…?" When a local billionaire—and the father of her childhood 
                        friend, a white boy named Davis—disappears, Aza (who seems to be white) and her BFF, Daisy Ramirez (who is cued as Latina), plot to find him and 
                        claim the reward, amid rumors of corruption and an underexplored side plot about semi-immortal reptiles. The story revolves around anxious Aza's 
                        dissociation from her body and life. Daisy chatters about Star Wars fan fiction (and calls Aza "Holmesy" ad nauseam), and Davis monologues about 
                        astronomy, while Aza obsesses over infection, the ever present, self-inflicted wound on her finger, and whether she's "just a deeply flawed line of 
                        reasoning." The thin but neatly constructed plot feels a bit like an excuse for Green to flex his philosophical muscles; teenagers questioning the 
                        mysteries of consciousness can identify with Aza, while others might wish that something—anything—really happens. The exploration of Aza's 
                        life-threatening compulsions will resonate deeply with some, titillate others, and possibly trigger those in between.Aza would claim that opinions
                         about this book are unfairly influenced by "the gut-brain informational cycle," which makes it hard to say what anyone else will think—but this
                         is the new John Green; people will read this, or not, regardless of someone else's gut flora. (Fiction. 14-18)
