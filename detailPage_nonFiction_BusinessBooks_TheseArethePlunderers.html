                    Pulitzer Prize­­­–winning and New York Times bestselling financial journalist 
                    Gretchen Morgenson and financial policy analyst Joshua Rosner investigate the 
                    insidious world of private equity in this “masterpiece of investigative journalism” 
                    (Christopher Leonard, bestselling author of Kochland)—revealing how it puts our 
                    entire economy and us at risk.

                    Much has been written about the widening gulf between rich and poor and how our 
                    style of capitalism has failed to provide a living wage for so many Americans. But 
                    nothing has fully detailed the outsized role a small cohort of elite financiers has 
                    played in this inequality. Pulitzer Prize­–winning journalist and bestselling author 
                    Gretchen Morgenson, with coauthor Joshua Rosner, unmask the small group of 
                    celebrated Wall Street financiers, and their government enablers, who use excessive 
                    debt and dubious practices to undermine our nation’s economy for their own 
                    enrichment: private equity.

                <p>
                    These Are the Plunderers traces the thirty-year history of corporate takeovers in 
                    America and private equity’s increasing dominance. Morgenson and Rosner 
                    investigate some of the biggest names in private equity, exposing how they buy 
                    companies, load them with debt, and then bleed them of assets and profits. All while 
                    prosecutors and regulators stand idly by.          
                </p>
                <p>
                    The authors show how companies absorbed by private equity have worse outcomes 
                    for everyone but the financiers: employees are more likely to lose their jobs or their 
                    benefits; companies are more likely to go bankrupt; patients are more likely to have 
                    higher healthcare costs; residents of nursing homes are more likely to die faster;
                     towns struggle when private equity buys their main businesses, crippling the local 
                    economy; and school teachers, firefighters, medical technicians, and other public 
                    workers are more likely to have lower returns on their pensions because of the fees 
                    private equity extracts from their investments. In other words: we are all worse off 
                    because of private equity.

                    These Are the Plunderers is a “meticulous and devastating takedown of a powerful 
                    force in Western capitalism” (Brad Stone, bestselling author of Amazon Unbound) 
                    that exposes the greed and pillaging in private equity, revealing the many ways these 
                    billionaires have bled the economy, and, in turn, us.

                    Morgenson, senior financial reporter for NBC News, and Rosner, a financial policy consultant, follow their 2011 collaboration, Reckless 
                    Endangerment, with a blistering critique of how private equity “extracts wealth from the many to enrich the few.” Damning case studies 
                    reveal how such firms as Apollo Global Management and the Blackstone Group have made billions by buying struggling enterprises and 
                    imposing drastic cost cutting to the detriment of customers and employees. The authors describe how in 2007, Apollo bought the Noranda 
                    smelting company in New Madrid, Mo., and forced it to take on hundreds of millions of dollars in debt to pay Apollo executives, cratering 
                    the region’s economy when the company shuttered under the weight of its debt. Detailing how firms stymie regulation, the authors trace how 
                    Blackstone funded a fake grassroots group that ran ads against legislation that would have reined in Blackstone’s practice of sending “surprise” 
                    medical bills to patients who used emergency rooms owned by the firm. Morgensen and Rosner excel at capturing the complex financial 
                    maneuverings in crisp, accessible prose, and horror stories about how buyouts shortchanged nursing home residents and life insurance policy 
                    holders drive home the callousness of the private equity business model. Fiery and incisive, this is an essential account of how Wall Street 
                    pilfers the pockets of ordinary Americans. (May)

                        The troubled story of private equity, which is anything but equitable.      
                    </span>
                    <span>
                        Private equity, write financial journalists Morgenson and Rosner, typically builds nothing. Instead, it leverages troubled companies, loots what 
                        assets they have, trims expenses to the bone, and often leaves acquisitions in bankruptcy or ruin. One philosopher the authors quote calls it 
                        “asshole capitalism,” and while the authors are a touch more genteel, they don’t hesitate to call the practitioners of “this rapacious form of 
                        capitalism” pirates and worse. By way of example, they look into the private-equity acquisition of nursing homes, a favorite target. In those
                         cases, equity ownership equates to a far higher death rate, more visits to emergency rooms, and increased Medicare costs. Private equity has 
                        also absorbed huge chunks of the medical sector, laying off doctors and cutting out essential services even at the height of the coronavirus 
                        pandemic. On that note, the authors observe, private owners took great pains to use the cheapest possible ventilators for Covid-19 patients in
                         critical care, which finally resulted in a federal fine of $40.5 million, a fraction of what they made. As Morgenson and Rosner clearly show, 
                        the pirates are flourishing; while there were but three “debt-fueled billionaires” in 2005, there were 22 in 2020. Much of this wealth comes 
                        from self-dealing, for apart from owning medical providers, private equity is also heavily invested in insurance, ripe with the possibilities of 
                        conflict of interest. No matter what the sector—and equity is now moving rapidly into education—the modus operandi is the same: “slash costs, 
                        eliminate higher-paid union workers, and reduce employee benefits; shut down less profitable divisions; or acquire competitors to bolster the 
                        pricing power of the company they own.” In addition, these firms, which have doubled in number in the last decade—are well protected in Congress.
