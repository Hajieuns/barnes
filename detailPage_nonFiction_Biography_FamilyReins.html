                    As an heir to the Anheuser-Busch company and fortune, Billy Busch was raised on 
                    the real stories of how his family built one of America’s oldest and most iconic 
                    brands. Since the company was formed almost 150 years ago, the Busch family, 
                    their beer, the famous Clydesdales in their advertising, and even their style of 
                    business have become a symbol of the American dream—that not-so-outdated belief 
                    that hard work, grit, and a positive can-do attitude make anything possible.

                    Growing up on the family’s ancestral estate as a prince to the King of Beers, Billy 
                    lived a life only kids could dream up—living in an amusement park, traveling by 
                    private rail car and yacht, and playing with his pet elephant, Tessie. But as he grew 
                    up, he realized that the Busch family legacy was not just wealth and privilege. With 
                    no separation between family and business, Billy’s father—more boss than dad—
                    continued the tradition of preparing the next generation for corporate leadership, 
                    with high and exacting standards for his children. For Billy, all of this, combined 
                    with a dysfunctional family environment, was all too normal.

                    Busch chronicles the ups and downs of his life as an heir of the Anheuser-Busch brewing company, and the circumstances that eventually 
                    led his family to lose control of the business, in this juicy debut memoir. He describes a seemingly idyllic childhood roaming his bucolic 
                    family estate outside St. Louis—complete with an amusement park and a pet elephant—and contrasts it with sketches of his emotionally 
                    absent parents (“I often sought solace from the people who worked for us, never once thinking to go to my parents for such things as 
                    affection and comfort”) and real-life family rivalries that could compete with Succession. Supplemented by eclectic photographs depicting 
                    the Busch family’s lavish lifestyle, the narrative details how their company overcame obstacles including Prohibition, only to be acquired 
                    by Belgian giant InBev in 2008 after the family’s ownership stake of the public company had dwindled over several decades. Busch’s 
                    efforts to “be present” and break the generational patterns of dysfunction with his wife and seven children add emotional depth, but 
                    his workmanlike prose sometimes falls flat (he sees “the varnish fade from the Busch Family Fairy Tale” several times). Still, as a 
                    bittersweet examination of an American business empire in decline, this succeeds. Photos. Agent: Mel Berger, WME. (Aug.)

                        For generations, the Busch family was synonymous with mass-produced beer, courtesy of an empire that began with a St. Louis brewery 
                        that churned out a popular lager. “We’re the poster children of the American dream,” writes the descendant author, “that not-so-outdated 
                        belief that hard work, entrepreneurship, grit, and a positive can-do attitude can make anything possible.” Corporate intrigue and familial 
                        back-stabbing helped, too, as Busch reveals when writing of how an older sibling deposed his father in an untidy coup occasioned by the 
                        father’s grief over the death of a daughter in a terrible accident. Busch sheds some useful insight into how a mass-produced brand out of 
                        the Midwest became a national standard, a process that began with the brewery empire’s throwing itself into the industrial effort in 
                        World War II, building parts for airplanes as well as supplying yeast tablets as energy supplements, so that “drinking Budweiser made 
                        you a patriot, a true American, someone who was helping the boys at home and abroad.” His narrative also supports the old saw that 
                        the first generation or two of entrepreneurs build an empire, the next one or two generations live lavishly off their labors, and the 
                        following generation or two drive the empire into the ground. The pattern holds, and the Busch descendants sold out to a giant 
                        conglomerate in 2008 after having turned the reins over to a scion with “a drug problem [who] was probably not fit for leadership.” 
                        Once that deal was done, the family went to war with each other and especially with the author, richly revealing themselves to be a 
                        group of supremely dysfunctional people that “just weren’t the type of family to get along.”

                        In Family Reins, Billy Busch, the founder of Busch Family Brewing & Distilling Company and heir to the multibillion-dollar Anheuser-
                        Busch fortune, goes well beyond the Busch Family Brewed reality show to share over a hundred and fifty years of family and business 
                        drama. Through wars, political upheaval, social unrest, and scores of family dramas, the Busch dynasty has remained an icon of not 
                        just American business, but American culture. Here, Billy Busch gives us unfettered access behind the curtain where we see the intimate 
                        details of a family dynasty—the good, the bad, and the ugly—and learn more than we could imagine about the incredible rise, and 
                        untimely fall, of an American Icon. Well written, well-paced, and deeply personal, this book reads like a bestselling novel, but all the 
                        more compelling because it is true. Not to be missed!”

                        In Family Reins, Billy Busch peels back the glitz and glamour of the Anheuser-Busch dynasty and gives readers an unflinching look into 
                        the soul of the American dream. From the breathtaking highs to the soul-crushing lows, Busch shatters our preconceived notions of 
                        wealth and privilege while drilling deep into the true meaning of family.”

                        USA Today bestselling author of Robert Ludlum̵ Joshua Hood
                        Busch draws on his twenty-twenty hindsight, working to avoid the pitfalls of the past in both business and home life, focusing on the 
                        sphere he can control. Launching his own brewery to honor the original family brewers, Billy engages readers with the effort put 
                        toward shaping his children’s understanding of family obligation and nurturing those relationships. This absorbing book is a good 
                        fit for public library collections.”

                        An heir to the Anheuser-Busch brewing fortune, Billy Busch is remarkably candid about both his life and the family succession issues that 
                        ultimately led to the purchase of the well-known corporation by InBev, a Belgian conglomerate. Busch's memoir seems backbiting, petty, 
                        and self-aggrandizing. Busch, who also narrates, frequently pauses inexplicably mid-sentence, especially during early chapters. Overall, 
                        his performance is sincere, workmanlike, and without noticeable emotional or tonal variation. While lacking in even the most basic rules
                         of English grammar and usage, the brief history, especially Anheuser-Busch's adaptations during two World Wars and Prohibition, 
                        evokes significant interest. Perhaps selecting a more professional narrator might well have improved the effort.
