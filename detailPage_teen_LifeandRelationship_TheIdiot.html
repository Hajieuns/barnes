                <p>
                    A new kind of coming-of-age narrative that reminds readers that to be American is 
                    to be from elsewhere. This is a brilliant, hilarious and moving novel that will 
                    resonate for some time.

                    A portrait of the artist as a young woman. A novel about not just discovering but 
                    inventing oneself.      
                </p>
                <p>
                    The year is 1995, and email is new. Selin, the daughter of Turkish immigrants, 
                    arrives for her freshman year at Harvard. She signs up for classes in subjects she has 
                    never heard of, befriends her charismatic and worldly Serbian classmate, Svetlana, 
                    and, almost by accident, begins corresponding with Ivan, an older mathematics 
                    student from Hungary. Selin may have barely spoken to Ivan, but with each email 
                    they exchange, the act of writing seems to take on new and increasingly mysterious 
                    meanings.           
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of the school year, Ivan goes to Budapest for the summer, and Selin 
                    heads to the Hungarian countryside, to teach English in a program run by one of 
                    Ivan's friends. On the way, she spends two weeks visiting Paris with Svetlana. 
                    Selin's summer in Europe does not resonate with anything she has previously heard 
                    about the typical experiences of American college students, or indeed of any other 
                    kinds of people. For Selin, this is a journey further inside herself: a coming to grips 
                    with the ineffable and exhilarating confusion of first love, and with the growing 
                    consciousness that she is doomed to become a writer.          
                </p>
                <p>
                    With superlative emotional and intellectual sensitivity, mordant wit, and pitch-
                    perfect style, Batuman dramatizes the uncertainty of life on the cusp of adulthood. 
                    Her prose is a rare and inimitable combination of tenderness and wisdom; its logic 
                    as natural and inscrutable as that of memory itself. The Idiot is a heroic yet self-
                    effacing reckoning with the terror and joy of becoming a person in a world that is 
                    as intoxicating as it is disquieting. Batuman's fiction is unguarded against both life's 
                    affronts and its beauty—and has at its command the complete range of thinking and 
                    feeling which they entail.

                    up late turning pages feverishly, but that will quietly amuse and provoke thought.” —Huffington Post

                    education, it’s one leavened by a great deal of mordant and delightful humor. . . . At once a cutting satire of academia, a fresh take 
                    on the epistolary novel, a poignant bildungsroman, and compelling travel literature, The Idiot’ is also a touching and spirited

                    The Possessed (2010), has brave and original ideas about what a 'novel' might mean and no qualms about flouting literary convention. 
                    She is endlessly beguiled by the possibilities and shortcomings of language . . . . It is a pleasure to watch Batuman render this process 
                    with the wit, sensitivity, and relish of someone who’s successfully emerged on the other side of it. For all of her fascination with linguistic

                     a perpetual stranger in a strange land. Her deceptively simple declarative sentences are underpinned by a poker-faced sense of absurdity

                    “With her smart and deliciously comic 2010 debut, the essay collection The Possessed, Elif Batuman wrote one of the 21st 
                    century’s great love letters to reading . . . It was a tour de force intellectual comedy encasing an apologia for literary obsession . . . 
                    A different—though no less tenuous—variety of possession is explored in The Idiot, Batuman’s first novel . . . The book’s pleasures
                     come not from the 400-page, low-and-slow smolder of its central relationship, which can at times feel like nothing more than two 
                    repressions circling one another; rather, it is Selin herself. Acutely self-conscious but fiercely intelligent, she consistently renders a 
                    strange, mordantly funny and precisely observed world . . . Selin’s is a consciousness one does not want to part with; by the end of 
                    the book, I felt as if I were in the presence of a strange, slightly detached, utterly brilliant friend. 'I kept thinking about the uneven 
                    quality of time,' she writes, 'the way it was almost always so empty, and then with no warning came a few days that felt so dense 
                    and alive and real that it seemed indisputable that that was what life was, that its real nature had finally been revealed.' Batuman 
                    articulates those little moments—of revelation and of emptiness—as well as anyone writing today. The book’s legacy seems 
                    destined to be one of observation, not character—though when the observer is this gifted, is that really any wonder?” —LA Times

                    innocence and experience, is infused with the generous attitude that Dag Hammarskjöld expressed in his memoir Markings, 'For

                        The mysterious relationship between language and the world” is just one of the questions troubling Selin Karadag, the 18-year-old protagonist of 
                        Batuman’s (The Possessed) wonderful first novel, a bildungsroman Selin narrates with fluent wit and inexorable intelligence. Beginning her first year 
                        at Harvard in the fall of 1995, Selin is determined to “be a courageous person, uncowed by other people’s dumb opinions”; she already thinks of 
                        herself as a writer, although “this conviction was completely independent of having ever written anything.” In a Russian class, the Turkish-American
                         Selin is befriended by the worldlier Svetlana, whose Serbian family has endowed her with capital and complexes, and the older Hungarian math major
                         Ivan, who becomes Selin’s correspondent in an exciting new medium: email. Their late-night exchanges inspire Selin more than anything else in her 
                        life, but they frustrate her, too: Ivan’s intentions toward her are vague, perhaps even to himself. Traveling to Paris with Svetlana in the summer of 
                        1996, Selin plans to continue on to Hungary, where she will teach English in a village school, and then to Turkey, where her extended family resides.
                         Thus Batuman updates the grand tour travelogue just as she does the epistolary novel and the novel of ideas, in prose as deceptively light as it is 
                        ambitious. One character wonders whether it’s possible “to be sincere without sounding pretentious,” and this long-awaited and engrossing novel 
                        delivers a resounding yes. (Mar.)

                        In this semiautobiographical debut novel, New Yorker writer and National Book Critics Circle finalist Batuman delightfully captures the 
                        hyperstimulation and absurdity of the first-year university experience. The story is set in the early 1990s, when Selin, a first-generation Turkish 
                        American girl from New Jersey, is introduced simultaneously to both email and Harvard. In Russian 101, she makes friends with Svetlana, a 
                        worldly Serbian emigré, and falls for handsome Hungarian upperclassman Ivan. Ivan's affection is elusive—he already has a girlfriend—and 
                        their relationship consists primarily of a plaintive yet intellectual email correspondence while Ivan travels about exploring graduate schools. 
                        To see Ivan over the summer, Selin commits to teaching English in Hungary. The unfamiliar language gives rise to a succession of seemingly 
                        random but mild misadventures. Despite its allusive title, this work is more modern fiction than Russian novel. The narrative is highly detailed 
                        and determinedly linear (compare Karl Ove Knausgaard or Ben Lerner), while the voice is lighthearted and wry, with occasional laugh-out-loud 
                        zingers. VERDICT Most readers will enjoy. [See Prepub Alert, 9/12/16.]—Reba Leiding, emeritus, James Madison Univ. Lib., Harrisonburg, VA

                        A sweetly caustic first novel from a writer whose work has appeared in the New Yorker, the Paris Review, and n+1. It's fall 1995, and Selin is just 
                        starting her first year at Harvard. One of the first things she learns upon arriving at her new school is that she has an email account. Her address 
                        contains her last name, "Karada?, but all lowercase, and without the Turkish ?, which was silent." When presented with an Ethernet cable, she asks 
                        "What do we do with this, hang ourselves?" All of this occurs on the first page of Batuman's (The Possessed: Adventures With Russian Books and the 
                        People Who Read Them, 2011) debut novel, and it tells us just about everything we need to know about the author's thematic concerns and style. 
                        Selin's closest friends at Harvard are Ralph, a ridiculously handsome young man with a Kennedy fetish, and Svetlana, a Serbian from Connecticut. 
                        Selin's first romantic entanglement—which begins via electronic mail—is with Ivan, a Hungarian mathematician she meets in Russian class. Selin 
                        studies linguistics and literature, teaches ESL, and spends a lot of time thinking about what language—and languages—can and cannot do. This 
                        isn't just bloodless philosophizing, though. Selin is, among other things, a young woman trying to figure out the same things young people are 
                        always trying to figure out. And, as it happens, Selin is delightful company. She's smart enough to know the ways in which she is dumb, and her 
                        off-kilter relationship to the world around her is revelatory and, often, mordantly hilarious. For example, this is how she describes a particular 
                        linguistics class: "we learned about people who had lost the ability to combine morphemes, after having their brains perforated by iron poles. 
                        Apparently there were several such people, who got iron poles stuck in their heads and lived to tell the tale—albeit without morphemes." Some 
                        readers may get impatient with the slow pace of the narrative, which feels more like a collection of connected microfictions than a traditional 
                        novel, but readers who are willing to travel with Selin at her own contemplative pace will be grateful that they did. Self-aware, cerebral, and delightful.
