                <p>
                    <strong>J.K. Rowling</strong> is the author of the enduringly popular Harry Potter books. After the 
                    idea for Harry Potter came to her on a delayed train journey in 1990, she plotted 
                    out and started writing the series of seven books and the first was published as 
                    Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone in the UK in 1997. The series took 
                    another ten years to complete, concluding in 2007 with the publication of Harry 
                    Potter and the Deathly Hallows.

                    Begun a decade ago and encompassing six shelf-bending novels, the seventh and concluding volume of the international literary phenomenon that is 
                    the Harry Potter saga comes to a bombshell-packed -- and oh so satisfying -- conclusion in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, arguably the most 
                    wildly anticipated release in modern publishing history.
                </span>

                    As the novel begins, Harry, Ron and Hermione are on the run from Lord Voldemort, whose minions of Death Eaters have not only taken control of 
                    the Minister of Magic but have begun to systematically -- and forcibly -- change the entire culture of the magic community: Muggle-born wizards,

                <span>
                    Undoubtedly Rowling's crowning literary achievement, this triumphant final installment not only answers any and all questions surrounding integral 
                    characters like Albus Dumbledore, Voldemort, Severus Snape, Neville Longbottom, and Draco Malfoy but also brilliantly deals with some decidedly 
                    adult themes -- mortality, faith, duty, honor, etc. -- with a lyrical simplicity that will touch the hearts of readers of all ages. ("Do not pity the dead...
                    pity the living, and, above all, those who live without love.") Rowling definitely saved the best for last in this saga; HP7 will exceed the expectations of 
                    even the most demanding Harry Potter fan -- a towering, transcendent end to an equally towering and transcendent series. Paul Goat Allen

                        J. K. Rowling's monumental, spellbinding epic, 10 years in the making, is deeply rooted in traditional literature and Hollywood sagas—from the Greek myths 
                        to Dickens and Tolkien to "Star Wars." And true to its roots, it ends not with modernist, "Soprano"-esque equivocation, but with good old-fashioned 
                        closure: a big-screen, heart-racing, bone-chilling confrontation and an epilogue that clearly lays out people's fates. Getting to the finish line is not seamless
                        —the last part of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final book in the series, has some lumpy passages of exposition and a couple of 
                        clunky detours—but the overall conclusion and its determination of the main characters' story lines possess a convincing inevitability that make some of the 
                        prepublication speculation seem curiously blinkered in retrospect.

                        It's hard to imagine a better ending than the one she's written for her saga after 10 years, more than 4,000 pages and close to 400 million copies in print. 
                        Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows may be a miracle of marketing, but it's also a miraculous book that earns out, emotionally and artistically. …I cried 
                        at the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. It's that rare thing, an instant classic that earns its catharsis honestly, not through hype or sentiment 
                        but through the author's vision and hard work.

                        Daletackles Harry's last hurrah with the same undercurrent of excitement and mind-boggling roster of distinct character voices that he brought to his 
                        previous six performances. Less of the Hogwarts setting, and a more dangerous quest for Harry and his friends, means that Dale has less jocularity to work 
                        with here (something at which he excels), but he does not disappoint in conveying both the heart-rending drama and sense of closure of Rowling's final 
                        Potter outing. Late in the recording, when Harry realizes his fate and Rowling's plot twists fly, Dale is at the top of his game, drawing listeners into the orbit 
                        of his comforting voice. Throughout, Harry and his friends appropriately sound a bit older than they did in the early volumes, and it's hard to know whether 
                        it's imagined or not, but there's a hint of wistfulness in Dale's voice, perhaps because both narrator and listener know it's the last time they'll be together for 
                        a new Potter adventure. The CD packaging, which makes extensive use of Mary GrandPré's spot illustrations and cover art on the discs and sleeves, is also a 
                        treat for fans. Ages 10-up. (July)

                        Gr 6 Up-Listeners may want to linger over Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Scholastic, 2007) since this is J. K. Rowling's last installment in her 
                        universally successful fantasy series. Howeverm the high-tension adventures of Harry assisted by Hermione and Ron will immediately draw everyone into 
                        the quest to vanquish Voldemort. With the Dark Lord in control of the Ministry of Magic, the trio uses their combined wizardly talents to stay hidden as 
                        they follow Dumbledore's assignment to destroy the dangerous horcruxes. Finding those fragmented pieces of their enemy's soul lead the friends to angry 
                        arguments, near fatal encounters and, occasionally, humorous episodes. Pursuing Dumbledore's oblique clues also reveal the truth behind a powerful, 
                        death-defying magic wand and stone, but that knowledge threatens to sidetrack the teens. The final confrontation is a bloody battle at Hogworts that 
                        involves the vast cast of creatures, allies and foes from the previous six volumes. In the end, Harry learns unexpected truths that are pivotal in the concluding 
                        struggle between good and evil. Narrator Jim Dale again serves up superbly distinctive characters and adds excitement when he narrates action scenes. 
                        Creating more than 200 voices for the Potter series, Dale has not only brought a rich vocal presence to the text, but he's also set an audiobook record for 
                        the number of characters portrayed. For those who've enjoyed the print version of the book, listening to this recording will extend and enhance the 
                        inspiring climax to this legendary septet.

                        School Library Journal - Barbara Wysocki
                        There’s only one word that can describe Jim Dale’s work on HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS—“magical.” Few audiobook narrators 
                        can stretch the medium like Dale as he interprets more than 200 characters, giving each a distinctive voice. Giants, wizards, elves, witches, centaurs, and 
                        muggles have singular voices that are instantly recognizable. It’s hard to imagine anyone else doing justice to J.K. Rowling’s brilliant finale to the story of the 
                        boy wizard as he conquers fear and turns into a man. Dale has raised the bar on audiobook interpretation so high it’s hard to imagine any narrator vaulting 
                        over it. If anyone were going to make a case that listening to an audiobook is superior to reading it, this book would be the best evidence. Bravo. M.S.
